\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this article, we introduce a family of varieties generalizing the Springer fibers. We prove an explicit presentation of their cohomology rings generalizing the one given by Tanisaki for the cohomology ring of a Springer fiber, which coincides with the rings $R_{n,\lambda,s}$ introduced by the first author~\cite{GriffinOSP}. As a special case, our construction gives a new \emph{compact} geometric realization of the  expression in the Delta Conjecture in the case $t=0$. We also prove a version of the Springer correspondence for this family of varieties, showing that their top cohomology groups have the $S_n$-module structure of an induced Specht module. Finally, we generalize work of de Concini and Procesi~\cite{dCP} by introducing a topological space whose cohomology ring coincides with the coordinate ring of the scheme-theoretic intersection of an Eisenbud--Saltman rank variety with diagonal matrices. 




In the seminal work~\cite{Springer-TrigSum,Springer-WeylGrpReps}, T.A. Springer introduced a family of varieties associated to any complete flag variety $G/B$, called Springer fibers, that have remarkable connections to the representation theory of Weyl groups. Springer proved that although the Weyl group does not act on a Springer fiber, it does act nontrivially on the cohomology ring of a Springer fiber. Furthermore, Springer proved that the highest degree nonzero cohomology group of a Springer fiber is (in type A) an irreducible representation of the Weyl group, and every irreducible representation appears this way. This is known as the \emph{Springer correspondence}. We note that the $S_n$-action discussed in this paper differs from Springer's original construction by tensoring with the sign representation.

The graded $S_n$-module type of the cohomology ring of a Springer fiber was discovered by Hotta and Springer~\cite{Hotta-Springer}. Under the Frobenius characteristic map $\Frob$ that associates a symmetric function to each $S_n$-module, the cohomology ring of a Springer fiber is sent to the \emph{modified Hall-Littlewood symmetric function}
\begin{align}
\Frob(H^*(\cB^\lambda;\bQ);q) = \widetilde H_\lambda(x;q^2),
\end{align}
where the $q$ on the left-hand side keeps track of the grading of the cohomology ring. A detailed analysis of this connection has been given by Garsia and Procesi~\cite{Garsia-Procesi}, who were inspired by the explicit quotient ring presentations for $H^*(\cB^\lambda;\bQ)$ discovered by De Concini-Procesi~\cite{dCP} and Tanisaki~\cite{Tanisaki}.

The Delta Conjecture of Haglund--Remmel--Wilson~\cite{HRW} predicts two combinatorial formulas for a particular symmetric function with $q$ and $t$ parameters $\Delta'_{e_{k-1}} e_n(q, t)$ coming from the theory of Macdonald polynomials. The conjecture is known to be true in several special cases, and the \emph{rise} version of the conjecture has recently been proven in full generality~\cite{DM}. Since $\Delta'_{e_{k-1}} e_n$ is conjectured to be Schur-positive, there is much interest in a natural algebraic or geometric construction of a (bigraded) $S_n$-module whose Frobenius characteristic is $\Delta'_{e_{k-1}} e_n$. Haglund--Rhoades--Shimozono~\cite{HRS1} did this in the case $t=0$ by constructing a graded ring $R_{n,k}$ with a suitable $S_n$-action whose graded Frobenius characteristic is $\Delta'_{e_{k-1}} e_n(q, 0)$ (after a minor twist).

Pawlowski and Rhoades~\cite{Pawlowski-Rhoades} gave a parallel geometric interpretation by exhibiting a complex algebraic variety whose cohomology ring is $R_{n,k}$. Since the Hilbert series of $R_{n,k}$ is not symmetric, such a variety must be either non-compact or singular by Poincar\'e Duality. Pawlowski defined the non-compact smooth space of \emph{spanning line arrangements}, $n$-tuples of lines in $\bC^k$ that span $\bC^k$,
\begin{align}
X_{n,k} \coloneqq \{(L_1,\dots, L_n) \in (\bP^{k-1})^n \st L_1+\cdots +L_n = \bC^k\}.
\end{align}
They proved that 
\begin{align}
H^*(X_{n,k}) \cong R_{n,k},
\end{align}
thus giving a connection between the expression in the Delta Conjecture at $t=0$ and geometry. 
Since the Poincar\'e series recording the graded dimensions of the ring $R_{n,k}$ is not symmetric, then by Poincar\'e duality, any complex variety whose cohomology ring is isomorphic to $R_{n,k}$ must either be noncompact or singular. 

In this article, we introduce a compact and singular variety $Y_{n,(1^k),k}$, similar to a Springer fiber, whose cohomology ring is the Haglund--Rhoades--Shimozono ring $R_{n,k}$. Thus, the variety $Y_{n,(1^k),k}$ gives a new geometric realization of the expression in the Delta Conjecture when $t=0$. Furthermore, the family $Y_{n,(1^k),k}$ extends to a family of varieties $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ generalizing the Springer fibers. This allows us to use techniques from the study of Springer fibers to analyze our varieties. Furthermore, it situates the study of $R_{n,k}$ and $\Delta'_{e_{k-1}}e_n$ in the context of the theory of Springer fibers and geometric representation theory.


As our main result, we prove an explicit presentation of the ring $H^*(Y_{n,\la,s})$ as a quotient of a polynomial ring, generalization Tanisaki's presentation for the cohomology ring of a Springer fiber~\cite{Tanisaki}. This presentation coincides with the graded ring $R_{n,\lambda,s}$ recently introduced by the first author~\cite{GriffinOSP}. 
As a consequence, we see that the cohomology ring of $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ has a graded $S_n$-module structure generalizing the classical one in the Springer fiber case.

We use results of the first author to prove a generalization of the  Springer correspondence to the setting of induced Specht modules. We show that for $s>\ell(\lambda)$, 
\begin{align}
H^{2d}(Y_{n,\lambda,s};\bQ) \cong \mathrm{Ind}\!\uparrow_{S_k}^{S_n} (S^\lambda),
\end{align}
where $d$ is the dimension of the variety $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ and $S^\la$ is the irreducible Specht module indexed by $\lambda$. In the special case when $s=\ell(\lambda)$, we show that the top cohomology group is a skew Specht module $S^{\Lambda/(n-k)^{s-1}}$. We also prove that $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ is equidimensional of complex dimension
\begin{align}
    d = \sum_i \binom{\lambda_i'}{2} + (s-1)(n-k),
\end{align}
and we give a characterization of the irreducible components of $Y_{n,\la,s}$.

Finally, we generalize results of de Concini and Procesi~\cite{dCP}. Let $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ be the Lie algebra of trace zero $n\times n$ matrices over $\bQ$. Given $\la\vdash n$, define $O_\lambda\subseteq \mathfrak{sl}_n$ to be the set of $n\times n$ nilpotent matrices over $\bQ$ with Jordan type $\lambda$, and let $\overline{O}_\lambda$ be its closure in $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. Let $\mathfrak{t}\subset \mathfrak{sl}_n$ be the Cartan subalgebra of diagonal matrices. Then de Concini and Procesi proved that
\begin{align}
    H^*(\cB^\la;\bQ) \cong \bQ[\overline{O}_{\la'}\cap \mathfrak{t}],
\end{align}
where the right-hand side is the coordinate ring of the scheme-theoretic intersection of $\overline{O}_{\la'}$ and $\mathfrak{t}$. Given a partition $\lambda$ of size at most $n$, let $\overline{O}_{n,\la}$ be the Eisenbud--Saltman rank variety (defined in Section~\ref{sec:IndVariety}). We define the direct limit space $Y_{n,\la} \coloneqq \varinjlim_s Y_{n,\la,s}$ and prove that there is an isomorphism of graded rings and graded $S_n$-modules
\begin{align}\label{eq:dCPGeneralization}
    H^*(Y_{n,\la};\bQ) \cong \bQ[\overline{O}_{n,\la'}\cap \mathfrak{t}].
\end{align}

In Section~\ref{sec:Background}, we outline preliminary definitions and previous results. In Section~\ref{sec:AffinePaving}, we define the variety $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ and prove that it has an affine paving given by intersecting $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ with Schubert cells. We then use this to compute the rank generating function of the cohomology ring.
In Section~\ref{sec:EmptyPartition}, we analyze the case of $\lambda=\emptyset$ and prove that the variety $Y_{n,\emptyset,s}$ has the same cohomology ring as a product of projective spaces.
In Section~\ref{sec:SpaltensteinAndCohomology}, we show that $Y_{n,\la,s}$ is the image of a projection down from a Spaltenstein variety, and we us this to prove a presentation of the cohomology ring of $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ as a quotient ring.
In Section~\ref{sec:IrreducibleComponents}, we prove our generalization of the Springer correspondence, and we characterize the irreducible components of $Y_{n,\la,s}$.
In Section~\ref{sec:IndVariety}, we introduce $Y_{n,\la}$ and prove the isomorphism \eqref{eq:dCPGeneralization}.
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:FutureWork} we list some open problems.

\subsection{Flag varieties and Schubert cells}


\SG{To do: Finish this section}

Given a vector space $V$, a \emph{partial flag} is a nested sequence of vector subspaces of $V$,
\begin{align}
    V_\bullet = (V_1\subset V_2\subset\dots\subset V_m).
\end{align}
Given a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $n_1\leq n_2\leq \cdots\leq n_m\leq \dim(V)$, define the \emph{partial flag variety} to be the set of partial flags of $V$ such that the dimensions of the subspaces are given by the sequence $(n_i)_i$,
\begin{align}
    \Fl_{n_1,\dots, n_m}(V) \coloneqq \{V_\bullet = (V_1\subset\dots\subset V_m) \st  \dim(V_i) = n_i\text{ for }i\leq m\}.
\end{align}
In the case when $V = \bC^n$ and $n_i = i$ for $i\leq n$, we recover the \emph{complete flag variety}, denoted by $\Fl(n) = \Fl_{1,\dots, n}(\bC^n)$.

\SG{To do: Define Schubert cells and Schubert varieties. State the fact that the PD classes of the Schubert varieties are a basis of cohomology here?}

\SG{Should we switch to indexing partial flag varieties by compositions and include the ambient space in our flag? If so, we should be careful about the Schubert conditions ($NV_i\subseteq V_i$ is different from $NV_i\subseteq V_{i-1}$ in that case)}

\subsection{Chern classes} 

Given a complex vector bundle $E$ on a topological space $X$, the $i$th Chern class of $E$ is a distinguished cohomology class $c_i(E)\in H^{2i}(X)$, where $c_0(E) = 1$. The Chern classes are invariants of the vector bundle, in the sense that if two vector bundles on $X$ are isomorphic, then their Chern classes agree.  

The sum of the Chern classes of a vector bundle $c(E) \coloneqq 1+c_1(E) + c_2(E) +\cdots$ is called the {\bf total Chern class} of $E$. It has the following useful properties.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Naturality: For any continuous map $f : X \to Y$ and any complex vector bundle $E$ on $Y$, then $f^*(c(E)) = c(f^*(E))$, where the first $f^*$ is the map on cohomology and $f^*(E)$ is the pullback of $E$.
    \item Additivity: Given a short exact sequence of vector bundles $0\to E'\to E\to E''\to 0$ on $X$, we have
    \begin{align}
        c(E) = c(E')c(E''),
    \end{align}
    where multiplication is via the cup product on cohomology.
    \item Vanishing: If $r$ is the rank of $E$ as a complex vector bundle, then $c_i(E) = 0$ for all $i>r$.
    \item Triviality: If $E \cong \bC^r \times X$, a trivial vector bundle, then $c(E) = 1$.
\end{itemize}

In the case of $X = \Fl(\bC^n)$, for each $j$ there is the tautological vector bundle $\widetilde V_j$ whose fiber over $V_\bullet = (V_1,\dots, V_n)$ is the vector space $V_{j}$. Borel~\cite{Borel} proved that the classes $c_1(\widetilde V_j/\widetilde V_{j-1})$ generate the cohomology ring $H^*(\Fl(\bC^n))$ as a graded algebra. Moreover, there is an isomorphism of graded algebras,
\begin{align}\label{eq:BorelTheorem}
    H^*(\Fl(\bC^n)) \cong \frac{\bZ[x_1,\dots, x_n]}{\langle e_1(x_1,\dots, x_n),\dots, e_n(x_1,\dots, x_n)\rangle}
\end{align}
identifying $-c_1(\widetilde V_j/\widetilde V_{j-1})$ with $x_j$, where each variable $x_j$ is considered to be degree $2$.
The quotient ring on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:BorelTheorem} is also known as the \emph{coinvariant ring}.





\subsection{Affine paving}

An affine paving is another tool that we will use for working with cohomology. Given a complex algebraic variety $X$, an {\bf affine paving} of $X$ is a sequence of closed subvarieties
\begin{align}
    X_0 \subseteq X_1\subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_m = X
\end{align}
of $X$ such that $X_i\setminus X_{i-1} \cong \bigsqcup_j A_{i,j}$ for locally closed subspaces $A_{i,j}$ such that for all $i,j$, $A_{i,j}\cong \bC^k$ for some $k$. The affine spaces $A_{i,j}$ are called the {\bf cells} of the affine paving.

An affine paving allows us to compute the ranks of the cohomology groups of $X$ with compact support. When $X$ is compact in the analytic topology, cohomology with compact support is the same as cohomology, so an affine paving gives us a way of computing the ranks of the cohomology groups.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:OddCohVanishes}
Suppose $X$ is a smooth or compact complex algebraic variety that has an affine paving. If $X_i\setminus X_{i-1} = \bigsqcup_{i,j} A_{i,j}$ is the decomposition of $X$ into affine spaces, then
\begin{align}
    H^{2k}_c(X) &\cong \bZ^{\#\{(i,j) \st \dim_\bC(A_{i,j}) = k\}}\\
    H^{2k+1}_c(X) & = 0,
\end{align}
for all $k\geq 0$.
\end{lemma}

Under certain conditions, affine pavings can also be used to prove that the map on cohomology corresponding to a continuous map is injective or surjective.
%
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:PavingSurj}
Suppose $X$ is a smooth compact complex algebraic variety and $Y\subseteq X$ is a closed subvariety of $X$. If $Y$ and $X\setminus Y$ have affine pavings, then the map on cohomology
\begin{align}
H^*(X)\to H^*(Y)
\end{align}
induced by the inclusion $Y\subseteq X$
is surjective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:OddCohVanishes}, all odd cohomology groups of $X$ and $Y$ and all odd cohomology groups with compact support of $X\setminus Y$ are zero. By the long exact sequence for compactly supported cohomology associated to the diagram $Y\hookrightarrow X\hookleftarrow X\setminus Y$, we have short exact sequences
\begin{align}\label{eq:SESCoh}
0 \to H^{2i}_c(X\setminus Y) \to H^{2i}(X) \to H^{2i}(Y)\to 0
\end{align}
for all $i$.
The surjectivity of the map on cohomology then follows from \eqref{eq:SESCoh}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:InjectiveCoh}
Suppose $f: X\to Y$ is a surjective continuous map between compact complex algebraic varieties. Suppose that $Y$ has an affine paving such that for each cell $A_{i,j}$,
\begin{align}
    f^{-1}(A_{i,j}) \cong Z_{i,j}\times A_{i,j}
\end{align}
for some nonempty compact complex algebraic variety $Z_{i,j}$ with an affine paving. Then the map on cohomology
\begin{align}
    H^*(Y)\to H^*(X)
\end{align}
is injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $Y$ has an affine paving, and $f^{-1}(A_{i,j})\cong Z_{i,j} \times A_{i,j}$, it can be seen that $X$ has an affine paving with cells $C\times A_{i,j}$, where $C$ runs over all cells of $Z_{i,j}$. 
 Therefore, $H_*(X)$ is freely generated by the fundamental classes $[C\times A_{i,j}]$. 

Since $Z_{i,j}$ is compact, there is a cell of $Z_{i,j}$ consisting of a single point, $C = \{\text{pt}\}$. Letting $f_* : H_*(X)\to H_*(Y)$ be the map on homology induced by $f$, we have
\begin{align}
f_*([\{\text{pt}\}\times A_{i,j}]) = [A_{i,j}],
\end{align}
hence $f_*$ is surjective. 
By the Universal Coefficient Theorem, the map $f^*$ is the dual of $f_*$, which is thus injective.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Springer fibers}

Given a partition $\lambda$ of $n$, let $N_\lambda$ be a $n\times n$ nilpotent matrix whose Jordan block sizes are recorded by $\lambda$. The {\bf Springer fiber} associated to $\lambda$ is
\begin{align}
    \cB^\lambda \coloneqq \{V_\bullet \in \Fl(n) \st N_\lambda V_i\subseteq V_i \text{ for all } i\leq n\}.
\end{align}
Springer proved that although $S_n$ does not act on $\cB^\lambda$, it does act on the cohomology ring of $\cB^\lambda$. We note that in this article, the action on the cohomology ring we consider differs from the one originally constructed by Springer by tensoring with the sign representation.

A remarkable property of this action is that it gives a geometric construction of the irreducible Specht modules. Indeed, the dimension of $\cB^\lambda$ as a complex variety is 
\begin{align}
    n(\lambda) \coloneqq \sum_i \binom{\lambda_i'}{2},
\end{align}
and the top nonzero cohomology group of $\cB^\lambda$ as an $S_n$-module is
\begin{align}
    H^{2n(\lambda)}(\cB^\lambda;\bQ) \cong S^\lambda.
\end{align}
Therefore, in Lie type A there is a bijection, known as the \emph{Springer correspondence}, between Springer fibers and the irreducible $S_n$-modules, up to isomorphism. 

Hotta and Springer~\cite{Hotta-Springer} proved that the map on cohomology induced by the inclusion $\cB^\lambda \subseteq \Fl(n)$,
\begin{align}
    H^*(\Fl(n)) \to H^*(\cB^\lambda),
\end{align}
is surjective and $S_n$-equivariant. Hence, by surjectivity the cohomology ring $H^*(\cB^\lambda)$ is generated by the cohomology classes $c_1(\widetilde V_i/\widetilde V_{i-1})$. Here, we are abusing notation and writing $\widetilde V_i$ for the restriction of this vector bundle to $\cB^\lambda$. 

There is an explicit presentation of $H^*(\cB^\lambda)$ as a quotient ring extending Borel's theorem~\cite{dCP,Tanisaki}. For all $i\leq n$, let $p_i(\lambda) = \la'_n + \la'_{n-1} +\cdots + \la'_{n-i+1}$, where $\la'_i = 0$ for all $i>\la_1$. Given $S\subseteq \{x_1,\dots, x_n\}$, define $e_d(S)$ to be the sum of all square-free products of variables in $S$ of degree $d$. Define the following ideal and quotient ring,
\begin{align}
    I_\lambda &\coloneqq \langle e_d(S) \st d > |S| - p_{|S|}(\lambda)\rangle,\\
    R_\lambda &\coloneqq \bQ[x_1,\dots, x_n]/I_\lambda.
\end{align}
Here, and throughout the paper, we consider $R_\lambda$ to be a graded ring where each variable $x_j$ is in degree $2$. Tanisaki proved that there is an isomorphism of graded rings
\begin{align}
    H^*(\cB^\lambda;\bQ) \cong R_\lambda
\end{align}
given by identifying the cohomology class $-c_1(\widetilde V_j/\widetilde V_{j-1})$ with the variable $x_j$.

For example, when $\lambda = (2,1)$, then $p_{1}(\lambda) = 0$, $p_2(\lambda) = 1$, and $p_3(\lambda) = 3$. Therefore, $I_\lambda$ is generated by $e_d(S)$ where $3\geq d>0$ and $|S|=3$, or $2\geq d>1$ and $|S| = 2$, so 
\begin{align}
I_{(2,1)} &= \langle e_1(x_1,x_2,x_3), e_2(x_1,x_2,x_3), e_3(x_1,x_2,x_3), e_2(x_1,x_2), e_2(x_1,x_3), e_2(x_2,x_3)\rangle\\
&= \langle x_1+x_2+x_3,\, x_1x_2+x_1x_3+x_2x_3,\, x_1x_2x_3,\, x_1x_2,\, x_1x_3,\, x_2x_3\rangle\\
&= \langle x_1+x_2+x_3,\, x_1x_2,\, x_1x_3,\, x_2x_3\rangle,
\end{align}
and $H^*(\cB^{(2,1)})\cong R_{(2,1)} = \bZ[x_1,x_2,x_3]/I_{(2,1)}$.


\subsection{Symmetric functions and the Delta Conjecture}

The representation theory of the group $S_n$ is closely related to the theory of symmetric functions.
A {\bf symmetric function} is a formal power series in the infinite variable set $\{x_1,x_2,\dots \}$ that is invariant under any permutation of the variables.
For $\la\vdash n$, let $e_\la(x)$ and $s_\la(x)$ denote the \emph{elementary symmetric functions} and \emph{Schur symmetric functions}, which form bases of the ring of symmetric functions. 

The Frobenius characteristic map gives a connection between symmetric functions and representations of $S_n$, which we define next. Given $\la\vdash n$, let $S^\la$ be the irreducible $S_n$-module indexed by $\la$, also known as a \emph{Specht module}. Given a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ over $\bQ$ which has the structure of a $S_n$-module, it decomposes as a direct sum of Specht modules
\begin{align}
V\cong \bigoplus_{\la\vdash n}(S^\la)^{c_\la}
\end{align}
for some nonnegative integers $c_\la$. The \emph{Frobenius characteristic} of $V$ is defined to be the symmetric function
\begin{align}
\Frob(V) = \sum_{\la\vdash n} c_\la s_\la(x).
\end{align}
Given a graded $S_n$-module $V = \bigoplus_{i = 0}^m V_i$ with finite-dimensional direct summands $V_i$, the \emph{graded Frobenius characteristic} of $V$ is
\begin{align}
\Frob(V;q) = \sum_{i=0}^m \Frob(V_i)q^i.
\end{align}


One well-known family of symmetric functions is the \emph{Macdonald symmetric functions} $\widetilde H_\lambda(x;q,t)$. In Mark Haiman's groundbreaking work~\cite{Haiman01,Haiman02}, he proved that $\widetilde H_\lambda(x;q,t)$ is the Frobenius character of the bigraded \emph{Garsia-Haiman module}~\cite{Garsia-Haiman}. 
One piece of Haiman's analysis uses linear operators $\Delta'_f$ on the space of symmetric functions~\cite{BGHT} whose eigenbasis is the set of Macdonald functions $\widetilde H_\lambda(x;q,t)$. 

Some major open problems following Haiman's work involve finding combinatorial and geometric interpretations for evaluations of this operator when $f$ is a complete elementary symmetric function.
One such problem, called the Delta Conjecture~\cite{HRW}, predicts two combinatorial formulas for the $q,t$ symmetric function $\Delta'_{e_{k}}e_n(q,t)$
in terms of combinatorial statistics on \emph{parking functions}. 
The Delta Conjecture has recently been proven by D'Adderio--Mellit~\cite{DM} and Blasiak--Haiman--Morse--Pun--Seelinger~\cite{BHMPS}.

There has been an ongoing search for algebraic and geometric interpretations of the expression $\Delta_{e_{k}}e_n(q,t)$ in the Delta Conjecture. Haglund, Rhoades, and Shimozono~\cite{HRS1} found an algebraic interpretation when $t=0$. Precisely, they defined the following ring $R_{n,k}$ depending on two positive integers $k\leq n$,
\begin{align}
    R_{n,k} = \frac{\bZ[x_1,\dots, x_n]}{\langle x_1^k,\dots, x_n^k,e_n,e_{n-1},\dots, e_{n-k+1}\rangle}.
\end{align}
When $k=n$, it can be checked that $R_{n,n}$ is equal to the usual coinvariant ring~\eqref{eq:BorelTheorem}.
They proved that the graded Frobenius characteristic of $R_{n,k}$ is $\Delta'_{e_{k-1}}e_n(q,0)$ at $t=0$, up to a minor twist:
\begin{align}\label{eq:DeltaTZero}
\mathrm{Frob}(R_{n,k};q) = \omega\circ \mathrm{rev}_q (\Delta'_{e_{k-1}}e_n(q,0)),
\end{align}
where $\omega$ and $\mathrm{rev}_q$ are simple idempotent operators on symmetric functions. Pawlowski and Rhoades then found a parallel geometric construction for $R_{n,k}$ as the cohomology ring of a space of spanning line arrangements~\cite{Pawlowski-Rhoades}.
An algebraic interpretation for the $q,t$ symmetric function $\Delta_{e_{k-1}}e_n$ has been conjectured by Zabrocki~\cite{Zabrocki} in terms of the bigraded super-diagonal coinvariant ring.




\subsection{The rings $R_{n,k}$ and $R_{n,\lambda,s}$}

We recall the definition and properties of the ring $R_{n,\la,s}$ introduced by the first author in \cite{GriffinOSP}, which simultaneously generalizes the cohomology ring of a Springer fiber $H^*(\cB^\lambda)$ and the Haglund--Rhoades--Shimozono ring $R_{n,k}$. 

Fix $k\leq n$, a partition $\la\vdash k$, and $s\geq \ell(\la)$.  Let $p^n_m(\la) = \la'_n +\cdots + \la'_{n-m+1}$, where $\la'_i= 0$ for all $i> \la_1$. The ideal $I_{n,\la,s}$ and ring $R_{n,\la,s}$ are defined as follows,
\begin{align}
I_{n,\la,s} &= \langle x_1^s,\dots, x_n^s\rangle + \langle e_d(S) \st S\subseteq \{x_1,\dots, x_n\}, \, d > |S| - p^n_{|S|}(\la)\rangle,\\
R_{n,\la,s} &= \bZ[x_1,\dots, x_n]/I_{n,\la,s}.
\end{align}
It can be checked that
\begin{itemize}
    \item When $n=k$, then $I_{n,\la,s} = I_{\lambda}$ for any $s$, thus $R_{n,\la,s} = R_\la$ in this case.
    \item When $\la = (1^k)$ and $s=k$, then $I_{n,(1^k),k} = I_{n,k}$, thus $R_{n,(1^k),k} = R_{n,k}$.
\end{itemize}

For a further example, let $n=4$, $\lambda = (2,1)$, and $s=2$. Then $I_{4,(2,1),2}$ is generated by $x_i^2$ for $i=1,2,3,4$ and the polynomials 
$e_d(S)$ for $S\subseteq \{x_1,\dots, x_4\}$ such that
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
	d &= 2 \text{ and }|S| = 4,\\
	d &= 4\text{ and }|S| = 4,\\
\end{aligned}
\qquad
\begin{aligned}
	d &= 3\text{ and }|S| = 4,\\
	d &= 3\text{ and }|S| = 3.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
We have
\begin{align*}
    I_{4,(2,1),2} &= \langle x_1^2,x_2^2,x_3^2,x_4^2,e_2,e_3,e_4,e_3(x_1,x_2,x_3),e_3(x_1,x_2,x_4),e_3(x_1,x_3,x_4),e_3(x_2,x_3,x_4)\rangle,\\
    &= \langle x_1^2,\, x_2^2,\, x_3^2,\, x_4^2,\, x_1x_2+x_1x_3+x_1x_4+x_2x_3+x_2x_4+x_3x_4,\\
    &\qquad x_1x_2x_3+x_1x_2x_4+x_1x_3x_4+x_2x_3x_4,\\ 
    &\qquad x_1x_2x_3x_4,\, x_1x_2x_3,\, x_1x_2x_4,\, x_1x_3x_4,\, x_2x_3x_4\rangle,
\end{align*}
and $R_{4,(2,1),2} = \bZ[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4]/I_{4,(2,1),2}$. 

Let $I_{n,\lambda,s}^\bQ$ be the ideal in $\bQ[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ given by the same generators as $I_{n,\lambda,s}$, and let $R_{n,\la,s}^\bQ = \bQ[x_1,\dots, x_n]/I_{n,\lambda,s}^\bQ$. 
The first author has proven a basis of $R_{n,\la,s}^\bQ$ generalizing the \emph{Artin basis} of the coinvariant ring. Define $\cA_{1,\emptyset,s} = \{1,x_1,\dots, x_1^{s-1}\}$ and $\cA_{1,(1),s} = \{1\}$. Let the set $\cA_{n,\la,s}$ be defined recursively as follows,
\begin{align}
    \cA_{n,\la,s} \coloneqq \bigsqcup_{i=1}^{\ell(\la)} x_n^{i-1} \cA_{n-1,\la^{(i)},s} \sqcup \bigsqcup_{i=\ell(\la)+1}^s x_n^{i-1} \cA_{n-1,\la,s},
\end{align}
where for $1\leq i \leq \ell(\la)$, $\la^{(i)}$ is the partition obtained by sorting the parts of \[(\la_1,\dots, \la_{i-1},\la_i-1,\la_{i+1},\dots, \la_{\ell(\la)})\]
and deleting a trailing zero if necessary.
Then $\cA_{n,\la,s}$ is a $\bQ$-basis of $R_{n,\la,s}^\bQ$~\cite[Theorem 3.18]{GriffinOSP}.

\SG{Should we move the following lemmata into the body of the paper? They are straightforward from the results in my thesis.}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:FreeZMod}
The set $\cA_{n,\la,s}$ represents a $\bZ$-basis of $R_{n,\la,s}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The proof of Lemma 3.14 in \cite{GriffinOSP} also proves that $\cA_{n,\la,s}$ is a $\bZ$-spanning set of $R_{n,\la,s}$. Since $\cA_{n,\la,s}$ represents a $\bQ$-linearly independent subset of $R_{n,\la,s}^\bQ$, then it also represents a $\bZ$-linearly independent subset of $R_{n,\la,s}$.
\end{proof}

Given $V = \bigoplus_{i\geq 0} V_i$ a graded free $\bZ$-module with graded pieces $V_i$ of finite rank $\mathrm{rk}(V_i)$, let the \emph{Hilbert--Poincar\'e series} of the module $V$ be 
\begin{align}
    \Hilb(V;q) \coloneqq \sum_{i\geq 0} \mathrm{rk}(V_i)q^i.
\end{align}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:FreeZMod}, $R_{n,\la,s}$ is a free $\bZ$-module. Under our convention that $x_i$ has degree $2$ for all $i$, we have the following recursive formula for the Hilbert series, which follows immediately by Lemma~\ref{lem:FreeZMod}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:RHilbRecursion}
We have
\begin{align}
    \Hilb(R_{n,\la,s};q) = \sum_{i=1}^{\ell(\la)} q^{2(i-1)} \Hilb(R_{n-1,\la^{(i)},s};q) + \sum_{i=\ell(\la)+1}^s q^{2(i-1)} \Hilb(R_{n-1,\la,s};q).
\end{align}
\end{lemma}

Since the set of generators of the homogeneous ideal $I_{n,\la,s}$ is closed under the action of $S_n$ permuting variables, $R_{n,\la,s}$ inherits the structure of a graded $S_n$-module. In order to prove our generalization of the Springer correspondence, we make use of a formula for the graded Frobenius characteristic of $R_{n,\la,s}$ proven in~\cite{GriffinOSP}. We state the formula and define the associated combinatorial objects in Section~\ref{sec:IrreducibleComponents} where we need it.

\section{Definition of $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ and an affine paving}\label{sec:AffinePaving}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\AW{We should say this is an analogue of the Tymoczko and Precup results for Hessenberg varieties and that we're using a similar approach.}

In this section, we define a family of varieties $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ that generalize the Springer fibers. We construct an affine paving of $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ by intersecting it with Schubert cells, analogous to the affine pavings for Hessenberg varieties constructed by Precup and Tymoczko~\cite{Precup-AffinePavings,Precup-Tymoczko-Parabolic,Tymoczko-LinearConditions}. We then use this affine paving to show that $H^*(Y_{n,\lambda,s})$ and $R_{n,\lambda,s}$ have the same Hilbert-Poincar\'e series.

Let $k\leq n$, where $k$ is a nonnegative integer and $n$ is a positive integer, let $\la\vdash k$, and let $s\geq \ell(\la)$. Define $\Lambda \coloneqq \Lambda(n,\lambda,s) \coloneqq (n-k+\lambda_1,\ldots,n-k+\lambda_s)$ and $K\coloneqq |\Lambda|=s(n-k)+k$. We define a variety $Y_{n,\la,s}$, which is our main object of study.
\begin{definition}
Let $N_\Lambda$ be a nilpotent matrix of Jordan type $\Lambda$. Define
\begin{align}
    Y_{n,\la,s}\coloneqq \{V_\bullet \in \Fl_{1,\dots,n}(\bC^K)\st N_\Lambda V_i\subseteq V_i\text{ for }i\leq n,\text{ and }\im(N_\Lambda^{n-k})\subseteq V_n\},
\end{align}
where $\im(N_\Lambda^{n-k})$ is the image of the linear map $N_\Lambda^{n-k}: \bC^K\to \bC^K$.
\end{definition}

\SG{How about the \emph{$\Delta$-Springer variety}??}

\begin{remark}
Since $N_\Lambda$ is nilpotent, it can be checked that the set of conditions $N_\Lambda V_i\subseteq V_i$ for $i\leq n$ on a partial flag $V_\bullet\in \Fl_{1,\dots,n}(\bC^K)$ is equivalent to the set of conditions $N_\Lambda V_i\subseteq V_{i-1}$ for $i\leq n$, where $V_0\coloneqq 0$. Therefore, the variety $Y_{n,\la,s}$ can alternatively be defined as
\begin{align}
    Y_{n,\la,s} = \{V_\bullet \in \Fl_{1,\dots,n}(\bC^K) \st N_\Lambda V_i\subseteq V_{i-1} \text{ for }i\leq n,\text{ and }\im(N_\Lambda^{n-k})\subseteq V_n\}.
\end{align}
We use these two definitions interchangeably throughout the paper.
\end{remark}
It can be checked that the isomorphism type of $Y_{n,\la,s}$, both as a variety and as a topological space, depends only on $\Lambda$ and not on the choice of $N_\Lambda$. It will be convenient to specify particular choices for $N_\Lambda$, which we do next. 

We denote by $[\Lambda]$ the Young diagram of $\Lambda$, following the English convention, considered as the set
$$[\Lambda]=\{(i,j)\mid 1\leq i\leq \ell(\Lambda), 1\leq j\leq \Lambda_i\}.$$
The cells in column $n-k+1$ and to the right form a copy of the Young diagram of $\lambda$, which we denote by $[\lambda]$. 
We think of a filling of the Young diagram as a function $T:[\Lambda]\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.
We say that a cell of $[\Lambda]$ or a label of $T$ is on the \textbf{right edge} if it is right most in its row.
See Figure~\ref{fig:Lambda} for an illustration of $[\Lambda]$ and $[\lambda]$, where the cells in the right edge of $[\Lambda]$ are shaded. 
%Given a label $a=T(i,j)$ of $T$ that is not on the right edge, define $s_T(a) \coloneqq T(i,j+1)$, the label immediately to the right of $a$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{LambdaExMain.eps}
    \caption{The Young diagram $[\Lambda]$, which has a copy of $[\lambda]$ in the upper right corner, highlighted in bold. The cells in the right edge of $[\Lambda]$ are shaded.
    %The maximal cells correspond to flags inducing a particular Jordan type on the nilpotent operator $N$.
    }
    \label{fig:Lambda}
\end{figure}

For any filling $T$ of $[\Lambda]$ satisfying the following conditions,
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(S1)] $T$ is a bijection between $[\Lambda]$ and $\{1,2,\dots, K\}$,
\item[(S2)] $T(i,j)\leq k$ for all $(i,j)\in [\lambda]$,
\end{enumerate}
we define a variety $Y_{T}$, as follows.
Fix an ordered basis $f_1,\ldots,f_K\in \mathbb{C}^K$, let $F_i=\vspan\{f_1,\ldots,f_i\}$ for all $i$ with $1\leq i\leq K$, and  define $N_T$ to be the nilpotent endomorphism
where $N_T(f_{T(i,\Lambda_i)}) = 0$ for $i\leq s$, and  $N_T(f_{T(i,j)})=f_{T(i,j+1)}$ for $i\leq s$ and $j<\Lambda_i$.  Note that $N_T$ has Jordan type
$\Lambda$ by construction.  
Define
\begin{align}
    Y_T \coloneqq Y_{n,\lambda,s,T}\coloneqq \{V_\bullet\in\Fl_{1,\ldots,n}(\mathbb{C}^K) \mid N_TV_i\subseteq V_i\text{ for all } i\text{, and } F_k\subseteq V_n\},
\end{align}
which is a specific instance of the variety $Y_{n,\la,s}$.

In order to show that the intersection of $Y_{T}$ with the Schubert decomposition of $\Fl_{1,\dots,n}(\bC^K)$ is a paving by affines,
%with respect to the ordered basis $e_1,\dots, e_K$ forms a paving by affines, 
we must first specify $T$ further. 
We say that $T$ is {\bf $(n,\lambda,s)$-Schubert compatible} if (S1), (S2), and the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(S3)] $T$ is decreasing along each row from left to right.%$T(i,j)>T(i,j+1)$ for all $(i,j)\in [\Lambda]$ with $j < \Lambda_i$.
\item[(S4)] For $(i,j)\in [\lambda]$, the label $T(i,j)$ is greater than all labels in column $j+1$. %$T(i+1,\Lambda_{i+1})>T(i,\Lambda_{i})$ for $i<s$.
\item[(S5)] The labels in the right edge of $T$ form an increasing sequence when read from top to bottom.%$T(i,j) > T(i',j+1)$ for $(i,j),(i',j+1)\in [\Lambda]$ with $j > n-k$.
\item[(S6)] Whenever $T(a,b)>T(c,d)$ for $b,d>1$, then $T(a,b-1)>T(c,d-1)$.
\end{enumerate}
If $n$, $\lambda$, and $s$ are obvious from context, we will simply say $T$ is {\bf Schubert compatible}.

%Observe that since there are $k$ boxes to the right of the $(n-k)$-th column of $\Lambda$, (S2) is equivalent to $b>n-k$ whenever $T^{-1}(k)=(a,b)$.

    \caption{A Schubert-compatible filling $T$ of $\Lambda(5,(2,1),3)$, and the action of $N_T$ on the basis vectors.}
    \label{fig:SchubertCompatible}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
Let $n=5$, $\lambda = (2,1)$, and $s=3$. Let $T$ be the Schubert-compatible filling of $\Lambda(5,(2,1),3)$ in Figure~\ref{fig:SchubertCompatible}. Then $Y_{5,(2,1),3}$ is the variety of partial flags $V_\bullet = (V_1,V_2,V_3,V_4,V_5)\in \Fl_{1,2,3,4,5}(\bC^9)$ such that the following conditions hold:
\begin{align}
N_T V_i &\subseteq V_{i} \text{ for } i \leq 5, \\
% N V_4\subseteq V_3,\, NV_3\subseteq V_2,\, NV_2\subseteq V_1,\, NV_1\subseteq 0,\\
V_5 &\supseteq F_3 = \vspan\{f_1,f_2,f_3\}.
\end{align}
For example, the partial flag 
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:PartialFlag}
\vspan\{ f_1 \} \subset \vspan\{ f_1,f_2 \} \subset 
\vspan\{ f_{1},f_{2},f_{4} \} \subset \vspan\{ f_{1},f_{2},f_{3},f_{4} \} \subset \vspan\{ f_{1},f_{2},f_{3},f_{4},f_{7}\}.
\end{equation*}
is in $Y_{5,(2,1),3}$.
\end{example}


\begin{example}\label{ex:ReadingOrder}
We construct a Schubert-compatible filling $T$ as follows. 
Let the \emph{reading order} of $[\Lambda]$ be the ordering of the cells given by scanning down the columns of $[\Lambda]$ from right to left. For $(i,j)\in [\Lambda]$, if $(i,j)$ is the $p$th cell in the reading order, then let $T(i,j)=p$. It can be checked that $T$ is a Schubert-compatible filling. See the left-most filling in Figure~\ref{fig:ReadingOrder} for an example of such a filling with $n=7$, $\lambda = (2,2)$, and $s=4$.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:S6}
Suppose $T$ is a Schubert-compatible filling. If $j<\Lambda_i$, then \[N_T (F_{T(i,j)}\setminus F_{T(i,j)-1}) \subseteq F_{T(i,j+1)}\setminus F_{T(i,j+1)-1}.\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have $N_T \, f_{T(i,j)} = f_{T(i,j+1)}$ by definition. Let $f_{T(a,b)}\in F_{T(i,j)}$ with $T(a,b) < T(i,j)$. If $b<\Lambda_a$, then since $T(a,b) < T(i,j)$, by (S6) we have $T(a,b+1) < T(i,j+1)$, and hence $N_T\, f_{T(a,b)} = f_{T(a,b+1)}\in F_{T(i,j+1)}$. Otherwise, if $b=\Lambda_a$, then $N_T\, f_{T(a,b)} = 0$. In either case, we have $N_T F_{T(i,j)} \subseteq F_{T(i,j+1)}$. 

If $v\in F_{T(i,j)}\setminus F_{T(i,j)-1}$, then the expansion of $v$ in the $f$ basis has a nonzero $f_{T(i,j)}$ coefficient. Therefore, the expansion of $N_T\, v$ in the $f$ basis has a nonzero $f_{T(i,j+1)}$ coefficient, so $N_T\, v\notin F_{T(i,j+1)-1}$. The lemma then follows.
\end{proof}



For $1\leq i \leq s$, define a {\bf flattening function} $\fl_T^{(i)}$ 
%and its inverse $\ufl^{(i)}$ \tcr{(do we really need separate notation for the inverse?)}, partitions $\Lambda^{(i)}$ and $\lambda^{(i)}$, 
and a filling $T^{(i)}$ as follows.
If $i\leq \ell(\lambda)$, then $\fl_T^{(i)}$ is the unique order-preserving function with the following domain and codomain,
\begin{align}
    \fl_T^{(i)} : [K]\setminus\{ T(i,\Lambda_i) \} \to [K-1],
\end{align}
and if $i> \ell(\lambda)$, then $\fl_T^{(i)}$ is the unique order preserving function
\begin{align}
    \fl_T^{(i)}: [K]\setminus(\{T(i,\Lambda_i)\}\cup \{T(i',1)\mid i'\neq i\}) \to [K-s].
\end{align}
For $i\leq \ell(\lambda)$, let $T^{(i)}$ be the filling obtained by deleting the last box in row $i$, applying $\fl_T^{(i)}$ to the label in each cell, and reordering the rows so that the labels of the cells in the new right edge are increasing from top to bottom.
For $i>\ell(\lambda)$, we also delete each cell $(i',1)$ for $i'\neq i$ and shift row $i'$ to the left by one unit before applying $\fl_T^{(i)}$ to form $T^{(i)}$.

See Figure~\ref{fig:ReadingOrder} for an example of a Schubert compatible filling $T$ and the fillings $T^{(1)}$ and $T^{(3)}$. When constructing $T^{(3)}$, the cells labeled by $7,13,14$, and $16$ are deleted, and rows $1,2$ and $4$ are shifted left by one unit. The cells are relabeled as follows: $\fl_T^{(3)}(8)=7$, $\fl_T^{(3)}(9) = 8$, $\fl_T^{(3)}(10) = 9$, $\fl_T^{(3)}(11)=10$, $\fl_T^{(3)}(12) = 11$, and $\fl_T^{(3)}(15)=12$. Then rows $3$ and $4$ are swapped to obtain $T^{(3)}$. It can be checked that both $T^{(1)}$ and $T^{(3)}$ are  Schubert compatible.

\begin{lemma}
If $i \leq \ell(\lambda)$, then $T^{(i)}$ is $(n-1,\lambda^{(i)},s)$-Schubert compatible. If $i > \ell(\lambda)$, then $T^{(i)}$ is $(n-1,\lambda,s)$-Schubert compatible.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By (S4), the labeling $T^{(i)}$ is of partition shape after sorting the rows by the labels in the right edge. It is immediate from the definitions that if $i\leq \ell(\la)$ then $T^{(i)}$ is of shape $\Lambda(n-1,\la^{(i)},s)$ and if $i> \ell(\la)$, then $T^{(i)}$ is of shape $\Lambda(n-1,\la,s)$. It also follows by construction that (S1) and (S2) hold for $T^{(i)}$.

Since the operations of deleting a cell, applying the flattening function to the labels, and possibly shifting a row to the left all preserve (S3), then $T^{(i)}$ has property (S3). Since (S4) only concerns labels of $[\lambda]$, and all cells of $[\lambda]$ are shifted left during the process of constructing $T^{(i)}$, then $T^{(i)}$ also satisfies (S4). The property (S5) is automatically satisfied by construction. Finally, $T^{(i)}$ satisfies (S6) since deleting a cell, relabeling, swapping rows, and shifting a row to the left all preserve the property (S6). Therefore, $T^{(i)}$ is Schubert compatible. 
\end{proof}

    \label{fig:ReadingOrder}
\end{figure}


%Given a Schubert-compatible filling $T$, define functions $s_T : [K]\to \bZ_{\geq 0}$ and $p_T : [K]\to \bZ_{\geq 0}$ as follows. Given $a\leq K$, let $(i,j) = T^{-1}(a)$. Define $s_T(a)=T(i,j+1)$ and $p_T(a)=T(i,j-1)$, where by convention we declare that $T(i',j')$ is $0$ if $(i',j')\notin \Lambda$.  (We want $s_T(a)=0$ if $a$ is in the last box?)


The set of injective maps $w:[n]\rightarrow [K]$ indexes the Schubert cells of $\Fl_{1,\ldots,n}(\mathbb{C}^K)$.
Given such a map, we say that $w$ is {\bf admissible} with respect to $T$ if both of the following hold.
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(A1)] The image of the map $w$ contains $[k]$.%\subseteq \{w(i)\mid i\in [n]\}$
    \item[(A2)] For $i\leq n$, if $w(i)=T(a,b)$ for $b<\Lambda_a$, then $T(a,b+1)\in \{w(1),\dots, w(i-1)\}$. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:NonemptyIntersections}
Assume $T$ is a Schubert-compatible filling.  Then  $C_w\cap Y_{T}\neq\emptyset$ if and only if $w$ is admissible.
\end{lemma}



\begin{proof}
If $w$ is admissible, then the partial flag $V_\bullet$ defined by $V_i=\langle f_{w(1)}, \ldots, f_{w(i)}\rangle$ is in $C_w\cap Y_{T}$, so $C_w\cap Y_{T} \neq \emptyset$. Therefore, it suffices to prove that if $C_w\cap Y_{T}\neq\emptyset$, then $w$ is admissible.

Given an injective map $w: [n]\to [K]$, recall that 
\begin{align}
    C_w = \{V_\bullet \in \Fl_{1,\dots, n}(\bC^K) \st \dim(V_i\cap F_j) = \#\{p\leq i \st w(p)\leq j\}\}.
\end{align}
Given $V_\bullet\in \Fl_{1,\dots, n}(\bC^K)$, then $F_k\subseteq V_n$ if and only if $\dim(V_n\cap F_k) = k$. Therefore, $F_k\subseteq V_n$ for some $V_\bullet\in C_w$ if and only if (A1) holds.

Suppose $C_w\cap Y_{T}\neq\emptyset$, and let $V_\bullet \in C_w\cap Y_{T}$. Suppose there exists a $i\leq n$ such that $w(i) = T(a,b)$ with $b<\Lambda_a$.
Then $\dim(V_i\cap F_{T(a,b)})>\dim(V_i\cap F_{T(a,b)-1})$, so $V_i\cap (F_{T(a,b)}\setminus F_{T(a,b)-1})\neq\emptyset$.  By Lemma~\ref{lem:S6}, we have $N_T (F_{T(a,b)}\setminus F_{T(a,b)-1}) \subseteq F_{T(a,b+1)}\setminus F_{T(a,b+1)-1}$. Hence,
\begin{align}
    N_T V_i \cap (F_{T(a,b)} \setminus F_{T(a,b+1)-1}) \neq \emptyset
\end{align}
and since $N_T V_i\subseteq V_{i-1}$, then
\begin{align}
    V_{i-1} \cap (F_{T(a,b+1)}\setminus F_{T(a,b+1)-1}) \neq \emptyset,
\end{align}
so $T(a,b+1)=w(i')$ for some $i'\leq i-1$. Hence, (A2) holds and $w$ is admissible.
\end{proof}

We define a linear transformation related to $N_T$ that we use throughout the paper.
\begin{definition}\label{def:NTranspose}
Define the nilpotent endomorphism $N^t_T$ of $\bC^K$ on the basis $\{f_1,\dots, f_K\}$ as follows,
\begin{align}
N^t_T \,f_{T(i,j)} \coloneqq \begin{cases} f_{T(i,j-1)} & \text{ if } j>1,\\ 0 & \text{ if }j = 1.\end{cases}
\end{align}
\end{definition}
Our notation is motivated by the fact that the matrix for $N^t_T$ with respect to the ordered basis $\{f_i\}$ is the transpose of the matrix for $N_T$. The transformation $N^t_T$ has the crucial property that 
\begin{align}\label{eq:NNTranspose}
N_TN^t_T \,f_{T(i,j)} = \begin{cases} f_{T(i,j)} &\text{ if } j > 1\\ 0 &\text{ if } j = 1.\end{cases}
\end{align}




\begin{lemma}\label{lem:InvertibleTransf}
Let $T$ be Schubert compatible, $w$ be admissible, and $w(1) = T(i,\Lambda_i)$. Given $v\in \vspan\{f_{T(h,\Lambda_h)}\st h<i\}$, then the linear transformation $U_v: \bC^K\to \bC^K$ defined by
\begin{align}
    U_v(f_{T(p,q)}) = \begin{cases} f_{T(p,q)} + (N^t_T)^{\Lambda_i-q}\,v & \text{ if }p=i\\ f_{T(p,q)} & \text{ otherwise.}\end{cases}
\end{align}
is upper triangular with $1$s along the diagonal such that $N_TU_v = U_vN_T$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
In the case $p=i$, the nonzero components of the vector $(N_T^t)^{\Lambda_i-q}\,v$ are $f_{T(j,\Lambda_j-(\Lambda_i-q))}$ for $j<i$. By (S5), we have $T(j,\Lambda_j) < T(i,\Lambda_i)$ for all $j<i$. Therefore, by applying (S6) $\Lambda_i-q$ many times, we have $T(j,\Lambda_j-(\Lambda_i-q)) < T(i,q)=T(p,q)$. Hence, $T_v$ is upper triangular with $1$s along the diagonal.

Given $f_{T(p,q)}$ such that $p\neq i$, then $N_T U_v f_{T(p,q)} = N_T f_{T(p,q)} = U_v N_T f_{T(p,q)}$, where the second equality follows from the fact that either $N_T f_{T(p,q)} = f_{T(p,q+1)}$ or $0$. On the other hand, if $p=i$, then 
\begin{align}
    U_v N_T f_{T(i,q)} = \begin{cases} f_{T(i,q+1)} + (N_T^t)^{\Lambda_i-q-1}v & \text{ if } q<\Lambda_i\\  0 & \text{ if }q = \Lambda_i,\end{cases}
\end{align}
Likewise, we have
\begin{align}
    N_T U_v f_{T(i,q)} = N_T f_{T(i,q)} + N_T(N_T^t)^{\Lambda_i-q}v 
\end{align}
If $q=\Lambda_i$, then this is equal to $N_Tv = 0$. Otherwise, $q<\Lambda_i$ and we have
\begin{align}
    N_T U_v f_{T(i,q)} = N_T f_{T(i,q)} + (N_T N_T^t) (N_T^t)^{\Lambda_i-q-1}v = f_{T(i,q+1)} + (N_T^t)^{\Lambda_i-q-1}v,
\end{align}
where the second equality follows from~\eqref{eq:NNTranspose}. Hence, $N_TU_v = U_vN_T$ and the proof is complete.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:CellRecursion}
Let $T$ be Schubert compatible, $w$ be admissible, and $w(1)= T(i,\Lambda_i)$. We have 
\[C_w\cap Y_{T}\cong \mathbb{C}^{i-1}\times (C_{\fl_T^{(i)}(w)}\cap Y_{T^{(i)}}).\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since
\begin{align}
    \vspan\{f_{T(j,\Lambda_j)}\st j<i\} \cong \bC^{i-1},
\end{align}
we may identify the two spaces as affine varieties. Define linear maps
\begin{align}
    \psi^{(i)} : \bC^{K-1} \to \bC^K & \,\,\,\text{  for  }i\leq \ell(\la),\\
    \psi^{(i)} : \bC^{K-s} \to \bC^K & \,\,\,\text{  for  }i > \ell(\la),
\end{align}
by $\psi^{(i)}(f_j) \coloneqq f_{(\fl_T^{(i)})^{-1}(j)}$, and extend linearly. 
Given $v\in \vspan\{f_{T(j,\Lambda_j)}\st j<i\}$ and $V_\bullet\in C_{\fl_T^{(i)}(w)}\cap Y_{T^{(i)}}$, define $\Phi(v,V_\bullet)$ to be
\begin{align}
   (\vspan\{f_{w(1)}+v\},\vspan\{f_{w(1)}+v\} + U_v\psi^{(i)}(V_1), \dots, \vspan\{f_{w(1)}+v\} + U_v\psi^{(i)}(V_{n-1})).
\end{align}


\textbf{Claim:} The partial flag $\Phi(v,V_\bullet)$ is in $C_w\cap Y_T$, so $\Phi$ is a well-defined map
\begin{align}\label{eq:PhiIso}
 \Phi : \vspan\{f_{T(j,\Lambda_j)}\st j<i\} \times (C_{\fl_T^{(i)}(w)}\cap Y_{T^{(i)}}) \to C_w\cap Y_T.
 \end{align}

It can be checked that since $V_\bullet\in C_{\fl_T^{(i)}(w)}$, then $\Phi(0,V_\bullet) \in C_w$.
Observe that $\Phi(v,V_\bullet) = U_v\Phi(0,V_\bullet)$, where $U_v$ acts on each subspace in the partial flag $\Phi(0,V_\bullet)$. Since $U_v$ is upper triangular with $1$s along the diagonal by Lemma~\ref{lem:InvertibleTransf}, it preserves the Schubert cell $C_w$, so $\Phi(v,V_\bullet)\in C_w$. In particular, since $w$ is admissible then the $n$th part of the partial flag $\Phi(v,V_\bullet)$ contains $F_k$. Furthermore, it can be checked that $N_T\psi^{(i)}(w)-\psi^{(i)}N_T^{(i)}(w)\in \ker(N_T)$ for all $w$ in the domain of $\psi^{(i)}$. Combining this with Lemma~\ref{lem:InvertibleTransf}, we have
\begin{align}
    N_T(\vspan\{v\} + U_v\psi^{(i)}(V_j)) = N_TU_v\psi^{(i)}(V_j) = U_v\psi^{(i)}N_{T^{(i)}}(V_j) \subseteq U_v\psi^{(i)}(V_{j-1}).
\end{align}
Hence, $\Phi(v,V_\bullet)\in C_w\cap Y_T$, which proves the claim.

To show that $\Phi$ is an isomorphism, it suffices to show that $\Phi$ has an inverse. Define linear maps
\begin{align}
    \phi^{(i)} : \bC^K \to \bC^{K-1} & \,\,\,\text{  for  }i\leq \ell(\la),\\
    \phi^{(i)} : \bC^K \to \bC^{K-s} & \,\,\,\text{  for  }i>\ell(\la),
\end{align}
by $\Phi^{(i)}(f_j) \coloneqq f_{\fl_T^{(i)}(j)}$ if $j$ is in the domain of $\fl_T^{(i)}$ and $0$ otherwise.
Given $V_\bullet\in C_w\cap Y_T$, there exist unique vectors $v_1,\dots, v_n$ with $v_i\in V_i$ such that the coefficient of $f_{w(i)}$ in $v_i$ is $1$ and the coefficient of $f_{w(i)}$ in $v_j$ is $0$ for all $i<j$. Define $V_i' = \vspan\{v_2,\dots, v_{i+1}\}$ for all $i$. Then it can be checked that the inverse of $\Phi$ is 
\begin{align}
    \Phi^{-1}(V_\bullet) = (v_1-f_{w(1)}, (\phi^{(i)}U_{v_1-f_{w(1)}}^{-1}(V'_1),\dots,\phi^{(i)}U_{v_1-f_{w(1)}}^{-1}(V'_{n-1}))).
\end{align}
Moreover, since $U_v$ can be represented by a unipotent upper triangular matrix whose coordinates are regular functions on $Y_{T}$, then the same is true of $U_v^{-1}$, and hence both $\Phi$ and $\Phi^{-1}$ are algebraic maps, so $\Phi$ is an isomorphism of algebraic varieties.
\end{proof}

 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:AffinePavingY}
If $T$ is Schubert compatible, then the intersections $C_w\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}$ for $w$ admissible are the cells of an affine paving of $Y_{n,\la,s,T}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since the Schubert cells $C_w$ are the cells of an affine paving of $\Fl_{1,\dots, n}(\bC^K)$, it suffices to show that each nonempty intersection $C_w\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}$ is isomorphic to an affine space $\bC^d$ for some $d$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:CellRecursion}, $C_w\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}$ is nonempty if and only if $w$ is admissible. We proceed by induction on $n$ to show that each of these intersection is an affine space. In the base case when $n=1$, either $\lambda =\emptyset$ or $\lambda = (1)$. In the first case, $Y_{1,\emptyset,s,T} = \bP^{s-1}$ for any Schubert-compatible $T$, the admissible $w$ are in bijection with $[s]$, and the nonempty intersections $C_w\cap Y_{1,\emptyset,s,T}$ can be identified with usual cells of $\bP^{s-1}$. In the second case, $Y_{1,(1),s,T}$ is a point, and the only nonempty intersection is a point. The inductive proof then follows by applying Lemma~\ref{lem:CellRecursion}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:CohHilbRecursion}
We have
\[
\Hilb(H^*(Y_{n,\la,s});q) = \sum_{i=1}^{\ell(\la)} q^{2(i-1)} \Hilb(H^*(Y_{n-1,\la^{(i)},s});q) + \sum_{i=\ell(\la)+1}^s q^{2(i-1)} \Hilb(H^*(Y_{n-1,\la,s});q).
\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Let $T$ be Schubert compatible. By Lemma~\ref{lem:OddCohVanishes}, the $q^{2i}$ coefficient of $\Hilb(H^*(Y_{n,\la,s});q)=\Hilb(H^*(Y_{n,\la,s,T});q)$ is the number of cells $C_w\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}$ for $w$ admissible that are complex dimension $i$. It can be checked that for $1\leq i\leq s$, then $\{\fl^{(i)}(w) \st w\text{ admissible}\}$ is the set of admissible injective maps for $T^{(i)}$. Thus, the subspaces $C_{\fl^{(i)}(w)}\cap Y_{T^{(i)}}$ are the cells of an affine paving for $Y_{T^{(i)}}$, by Theorem~\ref{thm:AffinePavingY}.  The corollary then follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:CellRecursion}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:RankGenNLaS}
The cohomology ring $H^*(Y_{n,\la,s,T})$ is a graded free $\bZ$-module concentrated in even degrees, whose rank generating function is equal to $\Hilb(R_{n,\la,s};q^2)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:AffinePavingY}, $Y_{n,\la,s,T}$ has a paving by affines where each cell is a copy of complex affine space. By Lemma~\ref{lem:OddCohVanishes}, all of the odd cohomology group vanish, and $H^{2i}(Y_{n,\la,s,T})$ is a free $\bZ$-module of rank equal to the number of cells of complex dimension $i$ in the paving.

We prove that the cohomology ring of $Y_{n,\la,s,T}$ and $R_{n,\la,s}$ have the same rank generating function by induction on $n$. In the case when $n=1$, then either $\la = \emptyset$ and $Y_{1,\emptyset,s,T} = \bP^{s-1}$, or $\la = (1)$ and $Y_{1,(1),s,T} = \bP^0$. In the first case, the rank generating function of $H^*(Y_{1,\emptyset,s,T})$ is $1 + q^2 +\dots + q^{2(s-1)}$. On the other hand, $R_{1,\emptyset,s} = \bZ[x]/(x^s)$, so the lemma holds in this case. In the second case, the rank generating function of $H^*(Y_{1,(1),s,T})$ is $1$, and $R_{1,(1),1}$ is the trivial $1$-dimensional ring, so the lemma holds in the base case.

Suppose $n>1$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:RHilbRecursion} and Corollary~\ref{cor:CohHilbRecursion}, the Hilbert series of $R_{n,\la,s}$ and the Hilbert series of $H^*(Y_{n,\lambda,s})$ satisfy the same recursion. Hence, the two $q$-series must be equal by induction on $n$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:Embedding}
Let $T$ be a $(n,\la,s)$-Schubert compatible filling of $\Lambda(n,\la,s)$, and let $T'$ be a $(n,\emptyset,s)$-Schubert compatible filling of $\Lambda(n,\emptyset,s) = (n^s)$ such that every entry of the $i$th row of $T$ is in the $i$th row of $T'$. Then the linear map $j : \bC^K \hookrightarrow \bC^{ns}$, which is the inclusion of the first $K$ coordinates, induces a closed embedding 
\begin{align}
\iota : Y_{n,\la,s,T}\hookrightarrow Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T'},
\end{align}
defined by sending the flag $V_\bullet\in Y_{n,\la,s,T}$ to the flag $(j(V_1),\dots, j(V_n))$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof follows from the fact that the entries of $T$ in row $i$ are right justified in row $i$ of $T'$. \SG{What details should we add?}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:AffinePavingDiff}
If $T$ is a Schubert-compatible filling, the space $Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T'}\setminus \iota(Y_{n,\la,s,T})$ has an affine paving.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:AffinePavingY}, the intersections $C_w\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}$ for $w$ admissible with respect to $T$ are the cells of an affine paving of $Y_{n,\la,s,T}$, and the intersections $C_v\cap Y_{n,\emptyset,s}$ for $v$ admissible with respect to $T'$ are the cells of an affine paving of $Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T'}$.

Given such a cell $C_w\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}$ with $w$ admissible with respect to $T$, define $w' : [n]\to [ns]$ by extending the codomain of $w$ to $[ns]$. Then $w'$ is admissible with respect to $T'$, and it can be checked that $\iota(C_w\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}) = C_{w'}\cap Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T'}$. Therefore, $Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T'}\setminus \iota(Y_{n,\la,s,T})$ has an affine paving given by removing the cells of the form $C_{w'}\cap Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T'}$ from the affine paving of $Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T'}$.
\end{proof}





\begin{corollary}\label{cor:Surj}
The closed embedding $\iota$ induces a surjection on cohomology,
\begin{align}
H^*(Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T}) \twoheadrightarrow H^*(Y_{n,\la,s,T'}).
\end{align}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
This follows immediately by Lemma~\ref{lem:PavingSurj}, Theorem~\ref{thm:AffinePavingY}, and Lemma~\ref{lem:AffinePavingDiff}.
\end{proof}




% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \section{Old affine paving of $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% In this section, we define the variety $Y_{n,\la,s}$, and we prove that it has a paving by affines. Moreover, we prove that every $Y_{n,\la,s}$ embeds as a closed subvariety of $Y_{n,\emptyset,s}$ and that the affine paving is compatible with this closed embedding.

% The variety $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ is defined as follows. Fix integers $0\leq k\leq n$ (with $n>0$), a partition $\lambda\vdash k$, and an integer $s\geq \ell(\lambda)$. Define $m = k + s(n-k)$, and let $\Fl_{1,\dots, n}(\bC^m)$ be the partial flag variety of ascending chains of subspaces $V_1\subset V_2\subset \cdots \subset V_n\subset \bC^m$ with $\dim_\bC(V_i) = i$ for all $i$. Fix a nilpotent endomorphism $N$ of $\bC^m$ whose matrix has Jordan type $(\la_1+n-k,\la_2+n-k,\dots, \la_s+n-k)$, where $\la_i \coloneqq 0$ for $i>\ell(\la)$. We define
% \begin{align}
% Y_{n,\la,s} \coloneqq \{V_\bullet \in \Fl_{1,\dots, n}(\bC^m) \st N V_i\subseteq V_{i-1}\text{ for all }i,\text{ and } V_n\supseteq \im(N^{n-k})\}.
% \end{align}
% When $k=n$, it can be checked that $Y_{n,\lambda,s} = \cB^\lambda$.

% Throughout the paper, we fix a basis of $\bC^m$,
% \begin{align}
% \{f_{i,j} \st i\leq s,\, j\leq \la_i+n-k\},
% \end{align}
%  such that $Nf_{i,j} = f_{i,j-1}$ for all $j>1$ and $Nf_{i,1} = 0$. The span of the vectors $f_{i,j}$ for a fixed $i$ is called a \emph{generalized eigenspace of $N$}.
 
 


% There is a filtration of $Y_{n,\la,s}$ by closed subvarieties $Y^1_{n,\la,s}\subseteq Y^2_{n,\la,s}\subseteq\cdots \subseteq Y^s_{n,\la,s}$, defined as follows. Observe that $\ker(N) = \vspan_\bC\{f_{1,1},\dots, f_{s,1}\}$. Let $F_\bullet$ be the complete flag of $\ker(N)$ given by $F_i = \vspan_\bC\{ f_{1,1},\dots, f_{i,1}\}$.
% For $i\leq s$, define
% \begin{align}
% Y_{n,\la,s}^i \coloneqq \{V_\bullet\in Y_{n,\la,s} \st V_1\subseteq F_i\},
% \end{align}
% where $Y_{n,\la,s}^0\coloneqq \emptyset$.
% Since $V_1\in \ker(N)$ for all $V_\bullet \in Y_{n,\la,s}$, we have $Y^s_{n,\la,s} = Y_{n,\la,s}$, so the subspaces $Y_{n,\la,s}^i$ form a filtration of $Y_{n,\la,s}$ by closed subvarieties.

% \begin{lemma}\label{lem:ProductIso}
% There is an isomorphism of varieties
% \begin{align}\label{eq:ProductIso}
% Y_{n,\la,s}^i \setminus Y_{n,\la,s}^{i-1} \cong \begin{cases} \bA^{i-1} \times Y_{n-1,\la^{(i)},s} & \text{if }1\leq i\leq \ell(\la)\\ \bA^{i-1}\times Y_{n-1,\la,s} & \text{if } \ell(\la)< i\leq s.\end{cases}
% \end{align}
% \end{lemma}

% \begin{proof}
% For any $i\leq s$, then $N$ induces a nilpotent transformation $N' : \bC^m/\langle f_{i,1}\rangle \to \bC^m/\langle f_{i,1}\rangle$. If $i\leq \ell(\la)$, then the Jordan type of $N'$ is
% \begin{align}
% (\la_1^{(i)} + n-k,\la_2^{(i)}+n-k,\dots, \la^{(i)}_s+n-k).
% \end{align}
% We then have an isomorphism of varieties
% \begin{align}
% \psi: \{V_\bullet \in Y_{n,\la,s} \st V_1 = \langle f_i\rangle \} \to Y_{n-1,\la^{(i)},s}
% \end{align}
% defined by $\psi(V_\bullet) = (V_2/\langle f_{i,1}\rangle,\dots, V_n/\langle f_{i,1}\rangle)$, which is a partial flag preserved by $N'$.

% If $\ell(\la) < i \leq s$, then $N'$ has Jordan type
% \begin{align}
% (\la_1+n-k,\dots,\la_{s-1}+n-k,\la_s+n-1-k).
% \end{align}
% By the same reasoning as in the first case, together with Lemma~\ref{lem:IsoWithLargerEmbedding}, we have an isomorphism
% \begin{align}
%  \{V_\bullet \in Y_{n,\la,s} \st V_1 = \langle f_i\rangle\} \cong Y_{n-1,\la,s}.
% \end{align}
% In order to prove the lemma, it suffices to prove
% \begin{align}\label{eq:ProdIsoWithDiff}
% F_{i-1}\times \{V_\bullet \in Y_{n,\la,s}\st V_1 = \langle f_{i,1}\rangle \} \cong Y_{n,\la,s}^i\setminus Y_{n,\la,s}^{i-1},
% \end{align}
% since $F_{i-1}\cong \bA^{i-1}$.


% Let $v$ be a vector in $F_{i-1}$. Define an invertible linear transformation $T_v : \bC^m \to \bC^m$ given by
% \begin{align}
% T_v(f_{i',j'}) = \begin{cases} f_{i',j'} +  (N^t)^{j'-1}\,v & \text{if } i'=i,\\ f_{i',j'} & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}
% \end{align}
% For $(v,V_\bullet)\in F_{i-1}\times \{V_\bullet\in Y_{n,\la,s}\st V_1 = \langle f_i\rangle\}$, we claim that $(T_v(V_1),T_v(V_2),\dots, T_v(V_n))\in Y_{n,\la,s}^i \setminus Y_{n,\la,s}^{i-1}$. Indeed, by construction of $T_v$ we have $T_v(V_1)\in \bP(F_i)\setminus \bP(F_{i-1})$. The transformation $T_v$ preserves $\im(N^{n-k})$, so we have that $T_v(V_n) \supseteq \im(N^{n-k})$. Using \eqref{eq:NNTranspose}, it can be checked that $NT_v = T_v N$. Therefore, $NT_v(V_h) = T_v(NV_h) \subseteq T_v(V_{h-1})$ for all $h\leq n$, and hence $(T_v(V_1),\dots, T_v(V_n))\in Y_{n,\la,s}^i\setminus Y_{n,\la,s}^{i-1}$, as claimed. 

% Therefore, we have a map
% \begin{align}\label{eq:IsoWithSetDiff}
% \varphi : F_{i-1} \times \{V_\bullet \in Y_{n,\la,s} \st V_1 = \langle f_{i,1}\rangle\} \to Y_{n,\la,s}^i \setminus Y_{n,\la,s}^{i-1}
% \end{align}
% defined by $\varphi(v,V_\bullet) = (T_v(V_1),T_v(V_2),\dots, T_v(V_n))$. It follows from the definition of $T_v$ that it is represented by a matrix whose coordinates are regular functions on $Y_{n,\la,s}$. 
% Using the fact that $T_v$ is invertible, it can then be checked that $\varphi$ is an isomorphism of varieties, hence \eqref{eq:ProdIsoWithDiff} holds, and we are done.
% \end{proof}


% %%%% Definition of cell indexing %%%%%%%%
% Define an indexing of the cells in the affine paving of $Y_{n,\la,s}$ by sequences as follows. When $n=1$ and $\la = \emptyset$, let $C_{(i)} = \bP(F_i)\setminus \bP(F_{i-1})\cong \bA^{i-1}$. When $n=1$ and $\la = (1)$, let $C_1 = Y_{1,(1),s} \cong \bA^0$, a single point. 

% For $n>1$, suppose we have already indexed the cells of all $Y_{n-1,\la,s}$ as $C_{(i_1,\dots, i_{n-1})}$ for sequences $i_1,\dots, i_{n-1}\leq s$. For $i\leq s$, let $C_{(i_1,\dots, i_{n-1})}$ be the cell of $Y_{n-1,\la^{(i)},s}$ if $i\leq \ell(\la)$, or the cell of $Y_{n-1,\la,s}$ if $i > \ell(\la)$. Define $C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$ to be the cell corresponding to $\bA^{i-1}\times C_{(i_1,\dots, i_{n-1})}$ under the isomorphism \eqref{eq:ProductIso}. Observe that
% \begin{align}\label{eq:DimOfCell}
% \dim_\bC (C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}) = \sum_{j\leq n} (i_j-1).
% \end{align}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



% \begin{lemma}\label{lem:Embedding}
% Let $j : \bC^m \hookrightarrow \bC^{ns}$ be the inclusion of the first $m$ coordinates, and let $\widehat N$ be a nilpotent matrix with Jordan type $(n^s)$ that restricts to the nilpotent matrix $N$ on $\bC^m$. The linear map $j$ induces a closed embedding 
% \begin{align}
% \iota : Y_{n,\la,s}\hookrightarrow Y_{n,\emptyset,s},
% \end{align}
% defined by sending the flag $V_\bullet\in Y_{n,\la,s}$ to the flag $(j(V_1),\dots, j(V_n))$ preserved by $\widehat{N}$. 
% \end{lemma}

% \begin{proof}
% The fact that $\iota$ is an embedding follows by Lemma~\ref{lem:IsoWithLargerEmbedding}.
% \end{proof}





% \begin{theorem}\label{thm:AffinePavingNLaS}
% The spaces $Y_{n,\la,s}$ and $Y_{n,\emptyset,s}\setminus \iota(Y_{n,\la,s})$ have affine pavings. 
% \end{theorem}

% \begin{proof}
% We proceed by induction on $n$. In the base case when $n=1$, then either $\la = \emptyset$ and $Y_{1,\emptyset,s} = \bP^{s-1}$, or $\la = (1)$ and $Y_{1,(1),s} = \bP^0$, so the lemma holds. In the general case with $n>1$, then by our inductive hypothesis $Y_{n-1,\la^{(i)},s}$ and $Y_{n-1,\la,s}$ have affine pavings. By Lemma~\ref{lem:ProductIso}, then $Y_{n,\la,s}^i\setminus Y_{n,\la,s}^{i-1}$ is a disjoint union of affine subspaces $C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$, and hence has a paving by affines.

% Given a cell $C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$ of $Y_{n,\la,s}$, it can be checked that $\iota(C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}) = C_{(j_1,\dots, j_n)}$ for some $(j_1,\dots, j_n)$. \tcr{Should we actually say what the correspondence is? Or should we switch our notation so that the ``rows'' are given by a composition instead of a partition and fix it so that $\iota(C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}) = C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$?}. Hence, $Y_{n,\emptyset,s}\setminus \iota(Y_{n,\la,s})$ has a paving by affines given by removing the image of each cell of $Y_{n,\la,s}$ under $\iota$.
% \end{proof}



% \begin{corollary}\label{cor:RankGenNLaS}
% The cohomology ring $H^*(Y_{n,\la,s})$ is a free $\bZ$-module concentrated in even degrees, whose rank generating function is equal to $\Hilb(R_{n,\la,s};q^2)$.
% \end{corollary}
% \begin{proof}
% By Theorem~\ref{thm:AffinePavingNLaS}, $Y_{n,\la,s}$ has a paving by affines where each cell is a copy of complex affine space. Therefore, all of the odd cohomology group vanish, and $H^{2i}(Y_{n,\la,s})$ is a free $\bZ$-module of rank equal to the number of cells of complex dimension $i$ in the paving, see e.g.~\cite{Hotta-Springer}.

% We prove that the rank generating function of the cohomology ring is equal to $\Hilb(R_{n,\la,s};q^2)$ by induction on $n$. In the case when $n=1$, then either $\la = \emptyset$ and $Y_{1,\emptyset,s} = \bP^{s-1}$, or $\la = (1)$ and $Y_{1,(1),s} = \bP^0$. In the first case, the rank generating function of $H^*(Y_{1,\emptyset,s})$ is $1 + q^2 +\dots + q^{2(s-1)}$. On the other hand, $R_{1,\emptyset,s} = \bZ[x]/(x^s)$, so the lemma holds in this case. In the second case, the rank generating function of $H^*(Y_{1,(1),s})$ is $1$, and $R_{1,(1),1}$ is the trivial $1$-dimensional ring, so the lemma holds in the base case.

% Let us assume that $n>1$. By \cite[Corollary 3.11]{GriffinOSP} and \cite[Theorem 3.18]{GriffinOSP}, the Hilbert series of $R_{n,\la,s}$ satisfies the following recursion,
% \begin{align}
% \Hilb(R_{n,\la,s};q^2) = \sum_{i=1}^{\ell(\la)} q^{2(i-1)} \Hilb(R_{n-1,\la^{(i)},s};q^2) + \sum_{i=\ell(\la)+1}^s q^{2(i-1)} \Hilb(R_{n-1,\la,s};q^2).
% \end{align}
% By Lemma~\ref{lem:ProductIso}, the rank generating function of $H^*(Y_{n,\la,s})$ satisfies the same recursion, hence the two $q$-series must be equal by induction.

%
%\begin{lemma}\label{lem:JordanTypeRestriction}
%Let $\nu = (\la_1 + n-k,\dots, \la_s + n-k)$. Given $V_\bullet\in C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}\subseteq Y_{n,\la,s}$, the Jordan type of the nilpotent endomorphism $N|_{\bC^m/V_n} : \bC^m/V_n\to \bC^m/V_n$ induced by $N$ is $\nu^{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$.
%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{proof}
%We proceed by induction on $n$. When $n=1$, recall that either $\la = \emptyset$ and $Y_{1,\emptyset,s} = \bP^{s-1}$, or $\la = (1)$ and $Y_{1,(1),s} = \bP^0$. In the first case, $\nu = (1^s)$, and $N = 0$ so the Jordan type of $N|_{\bC^m/V_n} = 0$ is $(1^{s-1})$ for all $V_\bullet \in Y_{n,\la,s}$. In the second case, $\nu = (1)$, $N=0$ and $Y_{1,(1),s}$ is a point, so the lemma trivially holds.
%
%Let $n>1$, and suppose the lemma holds for all smaller $n$. Let $V_\bullet\in C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$, where $C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$ corresponds to $\bA^{i-1}\times C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$ under the isomorphism \eqref{eq:ProductIso} where $i= i_n$. 
%
%Suppose $i\leq \ell(\la)$. By the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:ProductIso}, we have isomorphisms
%\begin{align}
%Y_{n,\la,s}^i\setminus Y_{n,\la,s}^{i-1} \stackrel{\varphi}{\leftarrow} F_{i-1}\times \{V_\bullet \in Y_{n,\la,s} \st V_1 = \langle f_i\rangle\} \stackrel{Id\times \psi}{\rightarrow} \bA^{i-1}\times Y_{n,\la^{(i)},s},
%\end{align}
%and $C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)} = \varphi\circ(Id\times \psi)^{-1}(C_{(i_1,\dots, i_{n-1})})$, by definition. Given $(v,V_\bullet)\in (Id\times \psi)^{-1}(C_{(i_1,\dots, i_{n-1})})$, then $(V_2/\langle f_i\rangle,\dots, V_n/\langle f_i\rangle)\in C_{(i_1,\dots, i_{n-1})}$, which is a partial flag preserved by $N' = N|_{\bC^m/\langle f_i\rangle}$, the nilpotent transformation induced by $N$. By our inductive hypothesis, the Jordan type of $N'|_{\bC^m/V_n}$ has Jordan type $(\nu')^{(i_1,\dots, i_{n-1})}$ where $\nu' = (\la^{(i)}_1 + n-k,\dots, \la^{(i)}_s + n-k)$. But clearly, $(\nu')^{(i_1,\dots, i_{n-1})} = \nu^{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$ by construction. 
%
%We have the equality $N|_{\bC^m/V_n} = N'|_{\bC^m/V_n}$, so$N|_{\bC^m/V_n}$ has Jordan type $\nu^{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$. Recall that $\varphi$ is defined by $\varphi(v,V_\bullet) = (T_v(V_1),\dots, T_v(V_n))$. Since $T_v N = NT_v$ and $T_v$ is an automorphism of $\bC^m$, then $T_v$ maps each generalized eigenspace of $N|_{\bC^m/V_n}$ isomorphically onto a generalized eigenspace of $N|_{\bC^m/T_v(V_n)}$. Hence, $N|_{\bC^m/T_v(V_n)}$ also has Jordan type $\nu^{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$. Therefore, the lemma follows. The proof in the case when $i >\ell(\la)$ is analogous.

\section{The case of $\lambda = \emptyset$}\label{sec:EmptyPartition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we analyze the variety $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$ in the case when $\lambda$ is the empty partition $\emptyset$. We prove that this space is an iterated projective bundle in Lemma~\ref{lem:ProjectiveBundle}. We then prove that $Y_{n,\emptyset,s}$ has the same cohomology ring as $(\bP^{s-1})^n$ in Lemma~\ref{lem:CohEmptyPartition}.

For all $i\leq n$, let $\widetilde V_i$ be the tautological rank $i$ vector bundle on $\Fl_{1,\dots, n}(\bC^{ns})$ for $i\leq n$. We abuse notation and also denote by $\widetilde V_i$ the restriction of $\widetilde V_i$ to the subvariety $Y_{n,\emptyset,s}$. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:ProjectiveBundle}
Let $T$ be a $(n,\emptyset,s)$-Schubert compatible filling such that the labels in the first column are $ns-s+1,\dots, ns$ in some order, and let $T'$ be the result of deleting the first column of $T$. Then the map
\begin{align}\label{eq:ForgettingMap}
Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T} \rightarrow Y_{n-1,\emptyset,s,T'},
\end{align}
given by forgetting the last subspace in the partial flag, is a $\bP^{s-1}$-bundle map.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By our assumptions, the nilpotent transformation $N_{T'}$ is the restriction of $N_T$ to the subspace $\vspan\{f_1,\dots, f_{n(s-1)}\}\subseteq \bC^{ns}$. Given any $V_\bullet\in Y_{n,\emptyset,T}$, then we have 
\begin{align}
V_{n-1} \subseteq \vspan\{f_1,\dots, f_{n(s-1)}\}.
\end{align}
Therefore, $(V_1,\dots, V_{n-1})\in Y_{n-1,\emptyset,s,T'}$, so the map \eqref{eq:ForgettingMap} is well-defined.

Given a subspace $V\subseteq \bC^{ns}$, let $N_T^{-1}(V)$ be the preimage of $V$ under the map $N_T : \bC^{ns}\to \bC^{ns}$. Observe that given $(V_1,\dots, V_{n-1})\in Y_{n-1,\emptyset,s,T'}$, an extension of this partial flag to $(V_1,\dots, V_{n-1},W)\in \Fl_{1,\dots, n}(\bC^K)$ is in $Y_{n,\emptyset,s}$ if and only if $W\subseteq N_T^{-1}(V_{n-1})$. We claim that for any subspace $V\subseteq \vspan\{e_1,\dots, e_{n(s-1)}\}$ of dimension $n-1$, then 
\begin{align}\label{eq:DimOfInvImage}
\dim_\bC (N_T^{-1}(V)) = s+n-1.
\end{align}
Indeed, define a linear map
\begin{align}
\varphi = N_T|_{N_T^{-1}(V)} : N_T^{-1}(V)\to V,
\end{align}
which is the restriction of $N_T$. It is clear that this map is surjective map, so \eqref{eq:DimOfInvImage} follows by rank-nullity and the fact that $\dim(\ker(N_T)) = s$.

Let $\widetilde{N_T^{-1}V}_{n-1}$ be the rank $s+n-1$ vector bundle on $Y_{n-1,\emptyset,s,T'}$ whose fiber over $V_\bullet$ is $N_T^{-1}(V_{n-1})$, and let $\widetilde V_{n-1}$ be the rank $n-1$ tautological vector bundle on $Y_{n-1,\emptyset,s,T'}$. We have an isomorphism
\begin{align}\label{eq:IsoOfProjBdl}
Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T} \cong \bP(\widetilde{N_T^{-1}V}_{n-1}/\widetilde V_{n-1}),
\end{align}
defined by sending $V_\bullet$ to the line $V_n/V_{n-1}$ over the point $(V_1,\dots, V_{n-1})$ of $Y_{n-1,\emptyset,s,T'}$. Hence, $Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T}$ is a $\bP^{s-1}$-bundle over $Y_{n-1,\emptyset,s,T'}$ via the forgetting map~\eqref{eq:ForgettingMap}.
\end{proof}



We note that the variety $Y_{n,\emptyset,s}$ is a special case of a Steinberg variety, as defined in~\cite{Borho-MacPherson,Precup-Tymoczko-Parabolic}. Its cohomology ring is known to be isomorphic to the ring of $(S_1\times \cdots S_1 \times S_{n(s-1)})$-invariants of the cohomology ring of the Springer fiber $H^*(\mathcal{B}^{\Lambda})$~\cite{Borho-MacPherson}. It is not hard to prove the next lemma using this fact, but we instead give a self-contained proof for the sake of completeness.



\begin{lemma}\label{lem:CohEmptyPartition}
There is an isomorphism
\begin{align}
H^*(Y_{n,\emptyset,s})\cong \frac{\bZ[x_1,\dots, x_n]}{\langle x_1^s,\dots, x_n^s\rangle},
\end{align}
that identifies $x_i$ with $c_1(\widetilde V_i/\widetilde V_{i-1})$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We may assume, without loss of generality, that the hypotheses in Lemma~\ref{lem:ProjectiveBundle} continue to hold. We proceed by induction on $n$. In the case $n=1$, the lemma follows from the fact that $Y_{1,\emptyset,s,T} = \bP^{s-1}$.
Suppose by way of induction that 
\begin{align}
H^*(Y_{n-1,\emptyset,s,T'}) \cong \frac{\bZ[x_1,\dots, x_{n-1}]}{\langle x_1^s,\dots, x_{n-1}^s\rangle}.
\end{align}
Let us denote $E \coloneqq \widetilde{N^{-1}V}_{n-1}/\widetilde V_{n-1}$.
By~\eqref{eq:IsoOfProjBdl}, we have an isomorphism
\begin{align}
Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T} \cong \bP(E),
\end{align}
so that $\widetilde V_n/\widetilde V_{n-1} \cong \mathcal{O}_E(1)$.
Hence, by Grothendieck's construction of Chern classes, we have
\begin{align}
H^*(Y_{n,\emptyset,s,T}) \cong \frac{H^*(Y_{n-1,\emptyset,s,T'})[x_n]}{\langle x_n^s + c_1(E)x_n^{s-1} + \cdots + c_s(E)\rangle}.
\end{align}

It suffices to prove $c(E) = 1$.
Indeed, observe that if $V_\bullet\in Y_{n-1,\emptyset,s,T'}$, then $V_{n-1}\subseteq \vspan\{e_1,\dots,e_{n(s-1)}\} = \im(N_T)$. Let $\bC^{ns}$ and $\im(N_T)$ be the corresponding trivial vector bundles on $Y_{n-1,\emptyset,s,T'}$. Consider the following short exact sequence of vector bundles,
\begin{align}
0 \to E\to \bC^{ns}/\widetilde V_{n-1}\to \im(N_T)/\widetilde V_{n-1} \to 0,
\end{align}
where the second map is the composition $E\hookrightarrow \bC^{ns} \twoheadrightarrow \bC^{ns}/\widetilde V_{n-1}$, and the third map is induced by $N_T$.
Then we have the following identity of Chern classes,
\begin{align}
c(E) = \frac{c(\bC^{ns}/\widetilde V_{n-1})}{c(\im(N_T)/\widetilde V_{n-1})} = c(\bC^{ns}/\im(N_T)) = 1,
\end{align}
which completes the proof.
\end{proof}


% \begin{lemma}\label{lem:IsoWithLargerEmbedding}
% Let $N'$ be a nilpotent matrix of Jordan type $(\la_1 + r_1,\dots, \la_s+r_s)$ for some integers $r_i \geq n-k$. Let $m' = k + \sum_i r_i$, and let $\{f_{i,j} \st i\leq s, j\leq \la_i+r_i\}$ be a basis of $\bC^{m'}$ such that $N' f_{i,1} = 0$ and $N' f_{i,j} = f_{i,j-1}$ for $j>1$. Let $S = \vspan_\bC \{f_{i,j} \st j\leq \la_i\}$. We have an isomorphism of varieties
% \begin{align}\label{eq:IsoOfExtendedSpace}
% Y_{n,\la,s} \cong \{V_\bullet \in \Fl_{1,\dots, n}(\bC^{m'}) \st N' V_i\subseteq V_{i-1}\text{ for all }i,\text{ and } V_n\supseteq S\}.
% \end{align}
% \end{lemma}

% \begin{proof}
% Let $V_\bullet$ be a flag in the space on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:IsoOfExtendedSpace}. We claim that 
% \begin{align}\label{eq:SubspaceContainmentWanted}
% V_n\subseteq \vspan_\bC\{f_{i,j} \st i \leq s, \,j \leq \la_i + n-k\}.
% \end{align}
% Otherwise, there exists a vector $v\in V_n$ that is not in this span. Letting $v = \sum_{i,j} a_{i,j} f_{i,j}$ be the expansion of $v$ in the $\{f_{i,j}\}$ basis, then $a_{i_0,j_0}\neq 0$ for some $i_0$ and $j_0> \la_i + n-k$. Then $\{v, N'v,\dots, (N')^{n-k}v\}$ is a set of linearly independent vectors in $V_n\setminus S$. Hence,
% \begin{align}\label{eq:SubspaceContainmentContradiction}
% V_n \supseteq \vspan_\bC \{v,N'v,\dots, (N')^{n-k}v\} + S,
% \end{align}
% where the vector space on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:SubspaceContainmentContradiction} has dimension $(n-k+1)+k>n$, a contradiction. Hence, the containment \eqref{eq:SubspaceContainmentWanted} holds.

% Identifying $\bC^m$ with the subspace on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:SubspaceContainmentWanted}, we see that $N'$ restricts to a nilpotent matrix $N$ of Jordan type $(\la_1+n-k,\dots, \la_s+n-k)$ such that $\im (N^{n-k}) = S$. Furthermore, the flag $V_\bullet$ is preserved by $N$. Hence, the space on the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:IsoOfExtendedSpace} is isomorphic to $Y_{n,\la,s}$.

\section{Spaltenstein varieties and the cohomology of $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$}\label{sec:SpaltensteinAndCohomology}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\SG{To do: Rewrite this section using Alex's notation}

In this section, we prove that there is a cellular surjective map from a Spaltenstein variety to $Y_{n,\la,s}$. We use this fact together with work of Brundan and Ostrik on the cohomology ring of a Spaltenstein variety~\cite{Brundan-Ostrik} to prove that the cohomology ring of $Y_{n,\la,s}$ is isomorphic to $R_{n,\la,s}$, stated as Theorem~\ref{thm:MainTheorem}.

Let us outline our strategy for proving that the cohomology ring of $Y_{n,\la,s}$ is isomorphic to $R_{n,\la,s}$. First, by Corollary~\ref{cor:Surj} we know that $H^*(Y_{n,\la,s})$ is a quotient of the ring
\begin{align}
\frac{\bZ[x_1,\dots,x_n]}{\langle x_1^s,\dots, x_n^s\rangle}.
\end{align}
By Corollary~\ref{cor:RankGenNLaS}, the rings $R_{n,\la,s}$ and $H^*(Y_{n,\la,s})$ are free $\bZ$-modules with the same rank generating function. Therefore, it suffices to prove that for each generator $e_d(S)$ of $I_{n,\la,s}$ with $S\subseteq \{x_1,\dots, x_n\}$, the same polynomial in the first Chern classes $x_i = c_1(\widetilde V_i/\widetilde V_{i-1})$ vanishes in $H^*(Y_{n,\la,s})$. To do this, we exhibit an injection from $H^*(Y_{n,\la,s})$ into the cohomology of a Spaltenstein variety, and we prove that the $e_d(S)$ polynomials in the first Chern classes vanish in the cohomology ring of the Spaltenstein variety.

Let us recall the definition of a Spaltenstein variety. Given an $m\times m$ nilpotent matrix $N_\nu$ of Jordan type $\nu\vdash m$ and a composition $\mu\vDash m$ of length $\ell$, the \emph{Spaltenstein variety} is
\begin{align}
\cB_\mu^{\nu} \coloneqq \{V_\bullet \in \Fl_{\mu_1,\,\mu_1+\mu_2,\dots,\, m}(\bC^m)\st N_\nu V_i \subseteq V_{i-1} \text{ for }i\leq \ell\}.
\end{align}
Let $X_j = \{x_{\mu_1+\cdots + \mu_{j-1}+1},\dots, x_{\mu_1+\cdots +\mu_j}\}$. Given $1\leq i_1<\cdots < i_p\leq \ell$, let 
\begin{align}
e_d(X;i_1,\dots, i_p) \coloneqq e_d(X_{i_1}\cup X_{i_2}\cup\cdots \cup X_{i_p}).
\end{align}
Furthermore, let $I_\mu^\nu$ be the following ideal of $\bZ[x_1,\dots, x_m]$,
\begin{align}
I_\mu^\nu \coloneqq \langle e_d(X;i_1,\dots, i_p) \st 1\leq i_1 < \cdots < i_p\leq \ell\text{ and }  d > \mu_{i_1} + \cdots + \mu_{i_p} - \nu'_{\ell-p+1} -\cdots - \nu'_m \rangle.
\end{align}
Brundan and Ostrik~\cite{Brundan-Ostrik} proved the following isomorphism of graded rings,
\begin{align}
H^*(\cB_\mu^\nu) \cong \frac{\bZ[x_1,\dots, x_m]^{S_{\mu}}}{I_{\mu}^\nu}.
\end{align}

Let us take $m = K$, $\nu = \Lambda$, and $\mu = (1^n,s-1,s-1,\dots, s-1)$, where $s-1$ is repeated $n-k$ many times, so that $\ell = 2n-k$. Observe that $\Lambda'_{n-k+i} = \la'_i$ for $i\geq 0$. Further observe that for each $j\leq n$, then $X_j = \{x_j\}$. Taking $1<i_1<\cdots <i_p \leq n$, then $e_d(x_{i_1},\dots, x_{i_p})\in I_\mu^\Lambda$ for
\begin{align}
d > p-\Lambda'_{(2n-k)-p+1} - \dots -\Lambda'_K,
\end{align}
or equivalently
\begin{align}
d > p-\la'_{n-p+1} - \dots - \la'_n.
\end{align}
The next lemma follows immediately from these observations.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:IdealContainment}
With $\mu$ as above, we have $I_{n,\la,s} \subseteq I_\mu^\Lambda$.
\end{lemma}



Observe that there is a map
\begin{align}
\pi : \cB_\mu^\Lambda \rightarrow Y_{n,\la,s}
\end{align}
given by projecting onto the first $n$ parts of the partial flag. Indeed, if $V_\bullet \in \cB_\mu^\Lambda$, then $V_{2n-k} = \bC^K$ by definition. Since $N_\Lambda V_i\subseteq V_{i-1}$ for all $i$, then $\im(N_\Lambda^{n-k}) = N_\Lambda^{n-k}V_{2n-k} \subseteq V_n$, so $\pi(V_\bullet) \in Y_{n,\la,s}$. 
In order to show that the map $\pi$ is a surjective cellular map, we need the following two lemmata, the second of which is a strengthening of Lemma~\ref{lem:InvertibleTransf} that only holds for a subclass of Schubert-compatible fillings.





\begin{lemma}\label{lem:LeadingTerm}
Let $T$ be a Schubert-compatible filling. If $j>1$, then
\begin{align}
    N^t_T(F_{T(i,j)}\setminus F_{T(i,j)-1})\subseteq F_{T(i,j-1)}\setminus F_{T(i,j-1)-1}.
\end{align} 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Sketch]
The proof is an application of (S6), similar to the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:S6}.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:TechnicalLemmaUnipotent}
Let $T$ be a Schubert compatible filling with the property that $T(i',j')>T(i,j)$ if $j'<j$. Let $w$ be admissible with respect to $T$, and let $V_\bullet\in Y_{n,\la,s,T}\cap C_w$. For all $p\leq n$, let $v_p$ be a vector in $V_p\setminus V_{p-1}$ whose $f_{w(p)}$ coefficient is $1$. Then there exists a unipotent upper triangular matrix $U$ such that 
\begin{align}\label{eq:UnipotentEq1}
U f_{w(p)} = v_p
\end{align}
for all $p\leq n$, and
\begin{align}\label{eq:UnipotentEq2}
UN_T f_{T(i,j)} = N_TU f_{T(i,j)}
\end{align}
for all $T(i,j) \notin\{w(1),\dots, w(n)\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Define the action of $U$ on the basis $\{f_{i}\}$ as follows. Let $(i_p,j_p)$ be the coordinates of the label $w(p)$ in $T$, so $w(p)=T(i_p,j_p)$. For $p\leq n$, we take \eqref{eq:UnipotentEq1} as a definition,
\begin{align}\label{eq:FirstUDef}
U f_{w(p)} \coloneqq v_p.
\end{align}
For each $T(i,j) \notin\{w(1),\dots, w(n)\}$, let $p\leq n$ be maximal such that $i = i_p$. If such a $p$ exists, define
\begin{align}
U f_{T(i,j)} \coloneqq (N^t)^{j_p-j} v_p.
\end{align}
If such a $p$ does not exist, define
\begin{align}
Uf_{T(i,j)} \coloneqq f_{T(i,j)}.
\end{align}
The matrix $U$ is unipotent upper triangular by Lemma~\ref{lem:LeadingTerm}.

It remains to show that \eqref{eq:UnipotentEq2} holds. Let $T(i,j)\notin \{w(1),\dots, w(n)\}$, and let $p\leq n$ be maximal such that $i=i_p$. If such a $p$ exists, then $j_p > j$ by admissibility condition (A2), and we have
\begin{align}
UN_T f_{T(i,j)} &= Uf_{T(i,j+1)} = (N_T^t)^{j_p-j-1}v_p,\\
N_TU f_{T(i,j)} &= N_T(N_T^t)^{j_p-j}v_p.
\end{align}
Therefore, in order for \eqref{eq:UnipotentEq2} to hold, we need that $N_T(N_T^t)^{j_p-j}v_p = (N_T^t)^{j_p-j-1} v_p$. By \eqref{eq:NNTranspose}, this holds if and only if the coefficient of $f_{T(i',1)}$ in $(N_T^t)^{j_p-j-1}v_p$ is zero for all $i'\leq s$. Hence, it suffices to show the coefficient of $f_{T(i',j_p-j)}$ in $v_p$ is zero for all $i'\leq s$. Indeed, if the coefficient of $F_{T(i',j_p-j)}$ in $v_p$ were nonzero, then since $v_p\in F_{T(i_p,j_p)}$, we have $T(i',j_p-j) \leq T(i_p,j_p)$. However, since $j_p-j<j_p$, this is impossible by our restriction on $T$ in the hypotheses of the lemma. Hence,  \eqref{eq:UnipotentEq2} holds in the case that $i = i_p$ for some $p$.

Suppose $i\neq i_p$ for all $p$. Recall that we have defined $Uf_{T(i,j)} = f_{T(i,j)}$. If $j<\Lambda_i$ then $Uf_{T(i,j+1)} = f_{T(i,j+1)}$, and so $UN_T f_{T(i,j)} = Uf_{T(i,j+1)} = f_{T(i,j+1)} = N_TUf_{T(i,j)}$. If $j=\Lambda_i$, then $Nf_{T(i,j)} = 0$, and we again have $UNf_{T(i,j)} = NUf_{T(i,j)}$. This verifies \eqref{eq:UnipotentEq2}, and the proof is complete.
\end{proof}







\begin{lemma}\label{lem:FiberBundle}
The map $\pi$ is surjective. Let $T$ be Schubert compatible and $w$ be admissible. Then we have
\begin{align}\label{eq:FiberBundleIso}
\pi^{-1}(C_{w}\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}) \cong (C_{w}\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T})\times \cB_{(s-1)^{n-k}}^{\Lambda'},
\end{align}
where $\Lambda'$ is the partition obtained by deleting cells labeled $w(1),\dots, w(n)$ from $T$, and then recording the row sizes of the remaining cells in weakly decreasing order.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let  $E_i = \vspan\{f_{w(1)},\dots, f_{w(i)}\}$ for $i\leq n$, which form the unique partial flag in $C_w$ such that each subspace is spanned by a subset of the $f$ basis. Let $N_T|_{\bC^K/E_n}$ be the nilpotent endomorphism induced by $N_T$ on the quotient space $\bC^K/E_n$, which has Jordan type $\Lambda'$.
 For each $p\leq n$, let $(i_p,j_p)$ be the coordinates of $w(p)$ in $T$, so $w(p) = T(i_p,j_p)$. Let $E'$ be the span of all of the $f_{i}$ basis vectors which are not in $E_n$.
 
 Let $V_\bullet\in C_w\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:TechnicalLemmaUnipotent}, there is a unipotent upper triangular matrix $U$ such that for all $p\leq n$,
\begin{align}
U E_p = V_p,
\end{align}
and for all $e'\in E'$, we have 
\begin{align}\label{eq:Commutativity}
N_TU e' = UN_T e'.
\end{align}

Consider $\cB_{(s-1)^{n-k}}^{\Lambda'}$ as the set of partial flags $(W_1,\dots, W_{n-k})$ fixed by the nilpotent transformation $N_T|_{\bC^K/E_n}$. We claim that for any $(V_1,\dots, V_n,V_{n+1},\dots, V_{2n-k})\in \pi^{-1}(C_{w}\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T})$, then 
\begin{align}\label{eq:ProductMapWellDefined}
(U^{-1} V_{n+1}/E_n,\dots, U^{-1}V_{2n-k}/E_n)\in \cB_{(s-1)^{n-k}}^{\Lambda'}.
\end{align}
 Indeed, it is evident that it is in the partial flag variety $\cB_{(s-1)^{n-k}}$. To show it is in $\cB_{(s-1)^{n-k}}^{\Lambda'}$, it suffices to prove that $N_T U^{-1} V_{n+i} \subseteq U^{-1} V_{n+i-1}$ for $i\geq 1$. Indeed, since $U^{-1} V_{n+i}\supseteq E_n$, we have the vector space decomposition
\begin{align}
U^{-1}V_{n+i} = E_n\oplus (U^{-1}V_{n+i}\cap E').
\end{align}
By \eqref{eq:Commutativity}, it follows that $N_T(U^{-1} V_{n+i} \cap E') = U^{-1} N_T U (U^{-1}V_{n+i}\cap E') = U^{-1}N_T(V_{n+i}\cap U E')$. Hence,
\begin{align}
N_TU^{-1} V_{n+i} &= N_T E_n + N_T(U^{-1}V_{n+i}\cap E') \\
&= N_TE_n + U^{-1} N_T(V_{n+i}\cap UE')\\
&\subseteq E_n + U^{-1} N_TV_{n+i} \\
&\subseteq U^{-1} V_{n+i-1}.
\end{align}
Thus,~\eqref{eq:ProductMapWellDefined} holds.

By \eqref{eq:ProductMapWellDefined}, we have a map
\begin{align}\label{eq:ProductMap1}
\pi^{-1}(C_{w}\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}) \to (C_{w}\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T})\times \cB_{(s-1)^{n-k}}^{\Lambda'},
\end{align}
defined by sending $(V_1,\dots, V_n,V_{n+1},\dots, V_{2n-k})$ to 
\begin{align}
((V_1,\dots, V_n), (U^{-1} V_{n+1}/E_n,\dots, U^{-1}V_{2n-k}/E_n)),
\end{align}
where $U$ depends on $(V_1,\dots, V_n)$, as defined above. Furthermore, it can be checked that the coordinates of the matrix representing $U$ are regular algebraic functions on the partial flag variety. Since $U$ is unipotent, then the coordinates of $U^{-1}$ are also regular algebraic functions, hence \eqref{eq:ProductMap1} is a map of algebraic varieties. 

A similar calculation following from \eqref{eq:Commutativity} shows that there is a map of algebraic varieties
\begin{align}\label{eq:ProductMap2}
(C_{w}\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T})\times \cB_{(s-1)^{n-k}}^{\Lambda'}\to \pi^{-1}(C_{w}\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}),
\end{align}
defined by sending $((V_1,\dots, V_n),(W_1,\dots, W_{n-k}))$ to 
\begin{align}
(V_1,\dots, V_n,UW_1+V_n,\dots, UW_{n-k}+V_n),
\end{align}
 where $U$ depends on $(V_1,\dots, V_n)$, as defined above.
 It can be checked that \eqref{eq:ProductMap2} is a map of varieties and that \eqref{eq:ProductMap1} and \eqref{eq:ProductMap2} are mutual inverses of each other. Thus, the isomorphism \eqref{eq:FiberBundleIso} follows.
 
To show that $\pi$ is surjective, it suffices to show that $\cB_{(s-1)^{n-k}}^{\Lambda'}\neq \emptyset$. This follows from the fact that $\nu^{\Lambda'}$ can be partitioned into $n-k$ vertical strips of size $s-1$ \SG{(should we add this detail or give a reference?)}. The proof is thus complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:InjCohomology}
The map on cohomology induced by $\pi$,
\begin{align}
\pi^* : H^*(Y_{n,\la,s}) \to H^*(\cB_\mu^\Lambda),
\end{align}
is injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:AffinePavingY}, for any Schubert compatible $T$, $Y_{n,\la,s,T}$ is paved by the affines spaces $C_{w}\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}$ for $w$ admissible, so $H_*(Y_{n,\la,s}) = H_*(Y_{n,\la,s,T})$ is freely generated by the classes $[C_w\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}]$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:FiberBundle}, we have an isomorphism $\pi^{-1}(C_{w}\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T}) \cong (C_{w}\cap Y_{n,\la,s,T})\times \cB_{(s-1)^{n-k}}^{\Lambda'}$. By \cite{Brundan-Ostrik}, each Spaltenstein variety $\cB_{(s-1)^{n-k}}^{\Lambda'}$ has a paving by affine spaces. The proof is then completed by applying Lemma~\ref{lem:InjectiveCoh}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:MainTheorem}
We have a degree-doubling isomorphism of graded rings
\begin{align}
R_{n,\la,s} \cong H^*(Y_{n,\la,s})
\end{align}
given by sending $x_i$ to $c_1(\widetilde V_{i}/\widetilde V_{i-1})$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Corollary~\ref{cor:Surj}, we have a surjection,
\begin{align}\label{eq:MapFromModPowers}
\frac{\bZ[x_1,\dots, x_n]}{\langle x_1^s,\dots, x_n^s\rangle} \twoheadrightarrow H^*(Y_{n,\la,s}),
\end{align}
given by sending $x_i$ to $c_1(\widetilde V_i/\widetilde V_{i-1})$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:IdealContainment}, we have that the cohomology class represented by $e_d(S)$ in $H^*(\cB_\mu^\Lambda)$ for $S\subseteq \{x_1,\dots, x_n\}$ is zero if $d>|S| - p^n_{|S|}(\la)$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:InjCohomology} and naturality of Chern classes, then the cohomology class represented by $e_d(S)$ in $H^*(Y_{n,\la,s})$ is zero as well. Hence, the map \eqref{eq:MapFromModPowers} descends to a map
\begin{align}
R_{n,\la,s} \twoheadrightarrow H^*(Y_{n,\la,s}).
\end{align}
Since both of these rings are free $\bZ$-modules and have the same rank generating function by Corollary~\ref{cor:RankGenNLaS}, this map is an isomorphism, and the proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\section{Irreducible components}\label{sec:IrreducibleComponents}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we characterize the irreducible components of $Y_{n,\la,s}$. We show that the number of irreducible components is equal to $\binom{n}{k}\cdot\#\SYT(\la)$ when $s>\ell(\la)$.

Given a sequence of partitions $\mu^\bullet = (\emptyset\subseteq \mu^{1}\subseteq \mu^{2}\subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mu^{n})$ such that $\mu^{i}/\mu^{i-1}$ consists of at most one box for all $i$, define the following subset of $Y_{n,\la,s}$,
\begin{align}
Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet} = \{V_\bullet \in Y_{n,\la,s} \st N|_{V_i\cap \im(N^{n-k})}\text{ has Jordan type }\mu^{i}\}.
\end{align}

\begin{lemma}
The subspaces $Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet}$ form a partition of $Y_{n,\la,s}$ into irreducible subspaces. If $s>\ell(\la)$, then $Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet}$ is nonempty if and only if $\mu^{n} = \la$. If $s = \ell(\la)$, then $Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet}$ is nonempty if and only if we have that $\mu^{n} = \la$ and $\mu^{i} = \mu^{i+1}$ implies $\mu^{i}_s = \la_s$. Furthermore, if $Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet}$ is nonempty, then
\begin{align}\label{eq:DimFormulaForCmpt}
\dim_\bC(Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet}) = n(\la) + (n-k)(s-1).
\end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $V_\bullet\in C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}$, then the Jordan type of $N|_{V_j\cap \im(N^{n-k})}$ is $\la^{(i_{j+1},\dots, i_n)}$. Therefore,
\begin{align}
Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet} = \bigsqcup_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)} C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}
\end{align}
where the union is over all sequences $(i_1,\dots, i_n)$ such that $\mu^{j} = \la^{(i_{j+1},\dots, i_n)}$ for $0\leq j \leq n$. It can then be seen from this that $Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet}$ is a product of projective spaces and affine spaces, hence it is irreducible. Furthermore, $Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet}$ is nonempty if and only if there exists at least one such sequence $(i_1,\dots, i_n)$. If $s>\ell(\la)$, the existence of such a sequence is equivalent to $\mu^n = \la$. If $s=\ell(\la)$, then the existence of such a sequence is equivalent to $\mu^n=\la$ and $\mu^i = \mu^{i+1}$ implies $\mu^i_s = \la_s$.

Suppose that $Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet}$ is nonempty, and recall that $\dim_\bC (C_{(i_1,\dots, i_n)}) = \sum_{j\leq n} (i_j-1)$. Then the dimension of $Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet}$ is the maximum of $\sum_{j\leq n} (i_j-1)$ over all $(i_1,\dots, i_n)$ such that $\mu^{j} = \la^{(i_{j+1},\dots, i_n)}$ for all $0\leq j \leq n$. To verify the dimension formula~\eqref{eq:DimFormulaForCmpt}, first observe that $\sum_{j\leq n}(i_j-1)$ is maximal if and only if the following two conditions hold.
\begin{itemize}
\item Whenever $\mu^j/\mu^{j-1}$ is a single box, then $i_j$ is the row index of the lowest box in that column of $\mu^j$,
\item Whenever $\mu^j/\mu^{j-1}$ is empty, then $i_j = s$.
\end{itemize}

\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
The space $Y_{n,\la,s}$ is equidimensional of dimension $n(\la) + (n-k)(s-1)$. The subspaces $\overline{Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet}}$ for which $Y_{n,\la,s}^{\mu^\bullet}$ is nonempty form a complete set of irreducible components. In the case $s>\ell(\la)$, there are $\binom{n}{k}\cdot \#\SYT(\la)$ many irreducible components.
\end{theorem}

The next theorem is a characterization of the top cohomology group of $Y_{n,\lambda,s}$. This result generalizes Springer's theorem that the top cohomology group is an irreducible.
 

\begin{theorem}
Let $d = \dim(Y_{n,\la,s}) = n(\la) + (n-k)(s-1)$, and consider $S_k$ as the subgroup of $S_n$ permuting the elements of $[k]$. For $s>\ell(\la)$, we have an isomorphism of $S_n$-modules
\begin{align}
H^{2d}(Y_{n,\la,s};\bQ) \cong \mathrm{Ind}\!\uparrow_{S_k}^{S_n} (S^\la).
\end{align}
For $s=\ell(\la)$, we have
\begin{align}\label{eq:SLengthLambdaIso}
    H^{2d}(Y_{n,\la,s};\bQ) \cong S^{\Lambda/(n-k)^{s-1}}.
\end{align}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The case when $s>\ell(\lambda)$ follows immediately by combining Theorem~\ref{thm:MainTheorem} with \cite[Corollary 3.3.15]{GriffinThesis}, which says that the top degree component of $R_{n,\lambda,s}$ is isomorphic~to~$\mathrm{Ind}\!\uparrow_{S_k}^{S_n}~\!(S^\lambda)$.

Let us now assume $s=\ell(\lambda)$. Combining Theorem~\ref{thm:MainTheorem} and  Theorem~\ref{thm:MonomialExpansion}, we have that
\begin{align}\label{eq:FrobCohMonomial}
    \Frob(H^{2d}(Y_{n,\lambda,s};\bQ);q) = \sum_{\substack{\varphi \in \mathrm{ECI}_{n,\lambda,s},\\ \mathrm{inv}(\varphi)=d}} \mathbf{x}^\varphi.
\end{align}
It can be checked that $\inv(\varphi) = d$  if and only if $\varphi_{i,j} > \varphi_{i+1,j}$ for $i<\lambda'_j$ and all basement cells are in column $\ell(\lambda)-1$.

It suffices to prove that the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:FrobCohMonomial} is equal to $s_{\Lambda/(n-k)^{\ell(\la)-1}}(x)$. Let $\alpha = (\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_n)$ be a weak composition of $n$.
The $x^\alpha$ coefficient of the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:FrobCohMonomial} is the number of $\varphi\in \mathrm{ECI}_{n,\la,s}$ of type $\alpha$ such that $\mathrm{inv}(\varphi) = d$. 

Given $\varphi\in \mathrm{ECI}_{n,\la,s}$ of type $\alpha$ such that $\mathrm{inv}(\varphi) = d$, define a labeling $T$ of the Young diagram of skew shape $\Lambda/(n-k)^{\ell(\lambda)-1}$ by labeling the $i$th row of $T$ from left to right with the labels of the $i$th column of $\varphi$, read from top to bottom, and then replacing each label $j$ with $n+1-j$. Since each column of $\varphi$ is weakly increasing from top to bottom, each row of $T$ is weakly increasing from left to right. Furthermore, since the rows of $\varphi$ are strictly decreasing from left to right, the columns of $T$ are strictly increasing from top to bottom. Therefore, $T$ is a semi-standard Young tableau of type $(\alpha_n,\alpha_{n-1},\dots, \alpha_1)$. Moreover, $\varphi$ can easily be reconstructed from $T$. 

Therefore, the coefficient of $x^\alpha$ in the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:FrobCohMonomial} is equal to the coefficient of $x^{(\alpha_n,\alpha_{n-1},\dots, \alpha_1)}$ in $s_{\Lambda/(n-k)^{\ell(\la)-1}}(x)$. Since both the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:FrobCohMonomial} and the skew-Schur function are symmetric, we conclude that these two symmetric functions are equal. Therefore, the isomorphism~\eqref{eq:SLengthLambdaIso} holds, and the proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\section{The space $Y_{n,\lambda}$}\label{sec:IndVariety}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we construct a topological space $Y_{n,\lambda}$ whose cohomology ring is isomorphic to $R_{n,\lambda}$. We then state a generalization of a theorem of de Concini and Procesi that relates Springer fibers to the scheme of diagonal ``nilpotent'' matrices.



For any $n$ and $\lambda\vdash k$, define the topological space $Y_{n,\la}$ as follows. Let $N$ be a nilpotent operator on the $\bC$-vector space $\bC^\infty$ with countably infinite dimension that has Jordan type \[(n-k+\la_1, \dots, n-k+\la_{\ell(\la)}, n-k,n-k,\dots).\] 
Then $\im(N^{n-k})$ has dimension $k$. It can be checked that 
\begin{align}
    Y_{n,\la}\coloneqq \{V_\bullet\in \Fl_{1,\dots,n}(\bC^\infty)\st NV_i\subseteq V_i \text{ for }i\leq n\text{ and }\im(N^{n-k})\subseteq V_n\}.
\end{align}
We have closed embeddings
\[
Y_{n,\la,\ell(\la)}\subseteq Y_{n,\la,\ell(\la)+1}\subseteq\cdots\subseteq Y_{n,\la,s}\subseteq\cdots.
\]
It can be checked that $Y_{n,\la}$ is the direct limit of these topological spaces,
\[Y_{n,\la} \cong \varinjlim_s Y_{n,\la,s}.\]

Let us recall the Universal Coefficient Theorem for Cohomology. It states that given any space $X$, there exists a split exact sequence
\[
0\to \mathrm{Ext}^1_\bZ(H_{i-1}(X),\bZ)\to H^i(X)\stackrel{h}{\to} \Hom(H_i(X),\bZ)\to 0
\]
where the map $h$ is defined as follows: given $\varphi: C_i(X)\to \bZ$ an $i$-cocycle, then $\delta \varphi =0$, where $\delta$ is the differential map on singular cocycles. Therefore,  we have $\varphi|_{B_i(X)}=0$, so $\varphi$ induces a map $\overline \varphi :Z_i(X)/B_i(X)\to \bZ$. The map $h$ is defined by $h([\varphi]) \coloneqq \overline\varphi$.


\begin{theorem}
We have $H^*(Y_{n,\la})\cong R_{n,\la}$ as graded rings.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:MainTheorem}, we have $H^*(Y_{n,\lambda,s})\cong R_{n,\la,s}$ From the definitions of $R_{n,\la}$ and $R_{n,\la,s}$, it can be checked that
\begin{align}
R_{n,\la} \cong \varprojlim_s H^*(Y_{n,\la,s}),
\end{align}
where the inverse limit is the limit in the category of graded rings. Therefore, it suffices to show that the natural map induced by the inclusions $Y_{n,\la,s}\subseteq Y_{n,\la}$,
\begin{align}\label{eq:NaturalMapCohToLim}
H^i(Y_{n,\la})\to \varprojlim_s H^i(Y_{n,\la,s}),
\end{align}
is an isomorphism for all $i$.

Since each $Y_{n,\la,s}$ is a $T_1$ space, then $Y_{n,\la,s}$ satisfies the hypotheses of \cite[Proposition 3.33]{Hatcher}, so the following natural map is an isomorphism
\begin{align}\label{eq:HomologyLimit}
\varinjlim_s H_i(Y_{n,\la,s}) \xrightarrow{\sim} H_i(Y_{n,\la})
\end{align}
for all $i$. Since each of the spaces $Y_{n,\la,s}$ has an affine paving, then $H_i(Y_{n,\la,s})$ is a free $\bZ$-module for all $i$, so $\mathrm{Ext}^1_\bZ(H_i(Y_{n,\la,s}),\bZ)=0$ for all $i$. Therefore, $H^i(Y_{n,\la,s})\cong \Hom(H_i(Y_{n,\la,s}),\bZ)$ by the Universal Coefficient Theorem for Cohomology. Hence, we have
\begin{align}
    Hom(H_i(Y_{n,\la}),\bZ) &\xrightarrow{\sim} Hom(\varinjlim_s H_i(Y_{n,\la,s}),\bZ)\\
    &\xrightarrow{\sim} \varprojlim_s Hom(H_i(Y_{n,\la,s}),\bZ)\\
    &\xleftarrow{\sim} \varprojlim_s H^i(Y_{n,\la,s}).
\end{align}


By \eqref{eq:HomologyLimit} and the fact that $H_i(Y_{n,\la,s}) \cong H_i(Y_{n,\la,s+1})$ for $s>i/2$, then $H_{i}(Y_{n,\la})$ is a free $\bZ$-module for all $i$, so $\mathrm{Ext}^1_\bZ(H_i(Y_{n,\la}),\bZ)=0$. Hence, by the Universal Coefficient Theorem for Cohomology, we have that
\begin{align}
H^i(Y_{n,\la}) \cong Hom(H_i(Y_{n,\la}),\bZ)
\end{align}
for all $i$, so 
\begin{align}\label{eq:CompOfIsoCoh}
H^i(Y_{n,\la}) \cong Hom(H_i(Y_{n,\la}),\bZ) \cong \varprojlim_s H^i(Y_{n,\la,s}).
\end{align}
In order to finish the proof, it must be checked that the composition of the isomorphisms in \eqref{eq:CompOfIsoCoh} is the same as the natural map \eqref{eq:NaturalMapCohToLim}. This is a routine check, and we omit it.
\end{proof}

\section{Future Work}\label{sec:FutureWork}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{question}
There is a $s$-dimensional torus action on $Y_{n,\la,s}$, given by scaling the vectors in each generalized eigenspace of $N$ by the same constant. The space $Y_{2,\emptyset,2}$ is not a GKM variety because it does not have finitely many one-dimensional orbits with respect to this action. Is it still possible to compute its equivariant cohomology ring? Brundan and Ostrik reference Goresky-Macpherson's characterization of equiv cohomology of Springer fibers in terms of subspace arrangements, and extensions of those results.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
What are the cell closures for the paving of $Y_{n,(1^k),k}$? Is there a nice description of the corresponding ``Bruhat poset''?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Can we identify the cohomology classes of the cell closures in the case of $Y_{n,(1^k),k}$?
\end{question}

 
 
 \begin{question}
 The space $Y_{n,\la,s}$ is usually singular because it has many irreducible components. Under what condition are all of the irreducible components smooth? Is this true for $Y_{n,(1^k),k}$, in particular?
 \end{question}
